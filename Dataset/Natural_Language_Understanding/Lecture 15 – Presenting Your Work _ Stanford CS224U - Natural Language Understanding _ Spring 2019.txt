that's 60 days I have a scratchy throat so forgive me for that but I think we'll will be able to manage without it today I'm going to talk a little bit about writing up and presenting your work into that I want to jump over to our syllabus in Oriental b three topics today I'm going to talk about reading up and presenting your work but we're also going to have a couple of Mini lectures I'm going to talk about data augmentation and Aquila is going to talk about probing blackbox models will have those in the second half of today's session before we get into that I want to make an announcement Chris mentioned this on piazza he posted this computer but just in case anyone missed it how to draw attention to the tube you in your final paper at the end of the paper to include a short section scribes the authorship of the paper soon authorship state this is a very concise statement that just says who contributed what to the final paper the very brief it could say for example a was mainly responsible for Gathering the data said person be was mainly responsible for model optimisation person sea was mainly responsible for writing the paper princess racing a Focus mainly on this approach person be focused on data process and they're both presented in the paper or it could say contributed equally to the data conducting experiments and writing the paper you it should be a truthful reflection of the relative contributions of the respective authors this is that we think that this is just scientific good practice in fact it's one that we'd like to see become more and more a part of the norms of the research community zizzari using a sander link here to the guidance it's given to the Japanese authors that's the proceedings of the national Academy of Science and we're hopeful that this will become more and more widespread in more and more venues for example in nacl which is the the dominant not intend or expect to use this information in assigning grades our expectation is that the team members together will all received the same grade not to assign the same grade to all members of a team but will do that only the most unusual cases and we wouldn't do that without discussing it first involved in the price yeah I think it can just be one line that says I'm the soul after in I responsible for everything anything for a solo Project I suppose it's just to meet the formal requirements a single sentence is it still appropriate but it doesn't need to save her questions about the final project before we go on today's classic session is the last regular class session maykway curry due to schedule time to meet with your mentor for the project to talk about the progress on the price is that should be the last regularly scheduled session breakfast spread this practice I couple of papers and you think it's a good practice my first Christmas as well this is spell responsibility and accountability making it clear the bowl for which parts of the paper unlikely in this class but there are exceptional situations where stability wind-up really matter if there are problems with a paper if there if concern arises that results were falsified or something like that who is responsible for that statement amount to the authors making clear I am responsible for this part of work and I staying behind soul my switch into the topic of writing up and presenting your work first I want to say a little bit about why we were talking about this little bit unusual because this is not a technical topic how to communicate the results of your work finding a way to communicate the results of your work clearly it's going to have impact yes you work both in written form and in spoken form so in an Oral presentation I think this type is unfortunately one that sometimes valued an engineers I think there is an unfortunate tendency to think that work will speak for itself it doesn't matter that much how you present have to forcefully disagree the great work will always speak for itself something happened this week that I kind of sharpen this for me a miracle man died on Friday miracle man is a great physicist you probably heard his name he's responsible for inventing the car introducing the theory that hadrons are made up of quarks in 1964 reading the book the biography of the what's the word thanks whether the obituaries I was reading pointed out that there is another guy independently arrived at the theory of Cork heard of George swag before I don't know it do you guys know this name his name I certainly heard of Mary gilman lights on my partner is missing something that is obituaries names is Concepts aces he came up with quirks somehow was it much more memorable name it was a sticky name play marketing marketing for his ideas everybody knows who kill man is a lot of people don't know whose white years I didn't know who he was another reason I had long career they did lots of other stuff girl man is responsible for tons of other advances in physics so I'm not think this is the only reason why girl man is well known hurt that he found a way to market his ideas in a very effective way Andaz engineer's we tend to think of marketing as a bit like respectable people you know don't spoil the Toyota hands with with marketing and thinking about her presenter ideas does make a difference and it will be a terrible shame if you invested a huge amount of work lighting data staying up late at night running experiments in being very innovative in your ideas in in your thinking follow through on that by finding a way to communicate your ideas in a way that will have a lasting impact on the community and the others benefit and your hard work what I want to focus on today and our hope is that by spending a little bit of time talking about this topic this is one of the unique benefits of this class that this class can be a very practical introduction the natural language understanding button how to be an effective research fellow in part of being an effective researcher is communicating a work in a way that's going to have impact will inspire you to think bigger than just this class of course your immediate goal is to finish your final in which I say will be more about at the end and write a final paper aim higher than that as well work that you're doing right now quickly to insight and ideas that wind up having lasting insulin mentioned that there was a student in I forget what I was last year 2 years have this inside about the hypothesis only baseline the language inference specifically for the nlsn idealist free impactful inside that show the community something really meaningful ask at least about that dataset 3 people had been optimising on on on the sly leaderboard so it really is possible for a class project to wind up having a larger impact on the research community papers from this class over the last several years that have been turned into conference papers had a broader reach think about the topics that we're looking at today is that when's the next step in your career will involve presenting your research to others it is certainly true if you want to go onto an academic career but it's even true for many positions in industry certainly any research oriented position in industry as part of the interview process still invite you to give a research talk where you go and Google or at Apple or even at a start it's a research project that you've been involved in an so finding a way to communicate that effectively not only helps to disseminate your research but also helps to ability and open doors for gonna talk about four different topics we'll talk about how to write a research paper specifically and NLP research paper a little bit about the conference submission process have sort of a an overview of how papers wind up getting accepted to conferences is on oral presentations and then I'll give you some very tactical tips on the video presentations that we're looking for for this class cartoon about writing papers sometimes it feels like this use an outline of a typical NLP paper the Field of NLP has evolved some conventions about how papers are typically structured can I give you give you a sense of what does conventions are so when you see papers that are presented the ACL or emnlp or Nicole or pacl they tend to follow these conventions more in a few minutes about what the conventions are but first I want to talk about why he's conjunction two reasons why it's a good idea to follow these conventions the conventions have evolved for a reason the community has the research community has converted on his convention effective because there are an effective way to communicate your ideas more why in a moment to follow conventions is that because their conventions easy for your audience to understand what they're Reading painted Rock the content of your papers will be technically dense already have a challenge turn the technical content double dare Challenge by making him also struggle to understand the rhetorical structure that you're trying to follow established conventions that would be an issue they know what to expect why they're reading with their reading and it will make it easier for them to understand your paper the the structure typically looks like this I'm not gonna dwell here because the next slide is somewhat redundant with this but I just say conventional ordering of sections NLP research paper the freedom to Riley conventions but if you're going to buy where the conventions you should do it very consciously and you should do it for a good reason what sort of haphazard this is Sean with 8 pages and it's because typically NLP conference papers are 8 pages with two columns single space convention is a convention for laying out and formatting which will follow in your final papers for this class not returning with the previous slide it's just sort of a different way of presenting go into a paper turn the tap on against that answer for might be someone arbitrary convention pensions are very well motivated is good reasons for them arbitrary and that one might be in Arabic arbitrary a great paper should have a narrative arc need to include these owners Prague just off is this problem import care about it done what approaches have others explored and why does a purchase not fully satisfactory run to do something more what's 3 the introduction to your paper that's kind of the preamble it was you you need to talk about doing the meat of your story what is the approach that you're going to follow what is the model that you're going to develop what distinguishes that from other things that have been done before tell me the longest part in the most technically dense part of your paper instrumental include a description of dataset if if you're if the dealer is it that you're working with is not completely standard something and lots of other people at work done so if you collected data you need to explain how you did that we need to talk about how you going to evaluate the success of what you did to talk about the evaluation itself the results of the evaluation some discussion significance of those results what does it mean what can we learn the strengths what are the limitations of the approach that you took and then perhaps finally some pointers to future work are almost surely the work that you've done is not complete it's not the last word limitations in whatever you did and if you can highlight with those limitations are opportunities for future work can you be a service by helping them identify what the next steps are further progress in this field what are the key elements of the story that you want to tell I did that off the top of my head but hopefully it aligns really well I think it is a line really well with what here stop there is a reason for all of these pieces you kind of need all of these pieces in order to have a complete story why does it matter what others done what are you do what was the result of the evaluation and what does it all mean Complete Story I'm going to talk about how to write a good abstract and also how to give a good talk repeat what I just said because the matter what format you're telling your story in it might be written or spoken it might be a pages long or might be a single paragraph have those key elements cheaper is yes in the middle section of the model open stride what is a decorative how you would write that particular part in some papers describe how you did feature engineering and then Indian variation here and room for personal preference donation would be too sort of do a two-pass approach first a top down and bottom-up start with a high level who's the overall picture of the system dive into individual pieces and describe the individual pieces back up to the top level and say how about species come together there's less of a community convention were prescriptive answer on had it into that question I think there's a little bit more room for variation Sheba is an NLP professor and researcher at Harvard and he has this play linked to here which is about reading grade papers and he talks about the Rational reconstruction form Italian thank you million dialectic here with a thesis and antithesis and synthesis ok so we start with the continental Style continental style is one that extremely concise leaving answer out will tell you how I got I am reminded of John Nash PhD thesis was 26 pages long 120 pages 1 not a smart is John Nash John Nash head to citations if you join Ash other people other people say my PC says Head Like 150 citation if your son asks you can get away with this just about anybody else recommended this is not the best way to communicate and how you got to them and make them understandable to others it's too cryptic it's too dense doesn't provide a way in Winchester historical style the narrative of your research process prime the whole research process in laborious detail and scanner it was a dark and stormy night when I begin to investigate the problem of natural language inference and you go on from there and describe all the things that didn't work then all the places where you got stuck it says the benefit of being more understandable than the the continental Style BB1 winner what is information that doesn't actually help anybody also not really the recommended approach and really the ideal approach is what starchy because the Rational reconstruction show me construction approach the problem in a way that makes the that you arrive at seem almost inevitable like a logical and natural the constraints of the prog the the whole approach and and why you did it Street Ford Escort that your solution is trivial fortunately conventions of the community conventions this kind of conventional narrative arc that I describe for this convention naturally bring you to this rational reconstruction Style this is not a narrative Anna pick Janice style PhD thesis a wave approaching a problem and it's driven by the motivations and constraints some hints on metal often x other mathematical notation in your paper they've got as some good hints on how to do that Nicole Miller talking about conferences first an xkcd cartoon this is one of my favourite this is an old xkcd cartoon number 541 regular xkcd Rita you know if these are numbered sequentially item for up to right now or something like that this is one of my favourite because how to put inside parentheses and I struggle with this don't you struggle with this we all struggle with guy who you know that we all struggle with this I also like this welcome to my TED Talk Kentucky Canada meme now what is the first person who like used it in this way to be funny a little bit about what it's like to submit NLP conference and what the review process is like and how your paper actually gets except you need to know if you actually submit a paper to edit a conference the other people in the run from the teaching team and maybe others as well who is Ben through this process and help your speak up and help fill in the gap with adaptor I'll leave her or share your own insight so here's an overview of the typical for getting a paper accepted first by the paper the best paper through there's usually a web interface where you upload your PDF and as part of the submission process keywords that you can choose for things like machine translation or computational semantics for natural language inference Run 2 of nlpc May correspond to specific techniques like reinforcement learning human annotation or something like strategies topic some topics of NLP that are particularly salient for your paper people upload not a lot of turtles reviewers actually the organisers the conference chairs typically has serious where is equal have area chairs The chairs are responsible for recruiting help review papers in the air is the papers into areas in large part based on a keyword put on a webpage listen many papers and invite all the reviewers to come look at the list and submit bids on which ones they want to be responsible for a review you see this web page with 100 papers on play crew to get the abstract of the paper c is after names or affiliations or anything like that you will see the keywords that are on the you need to choose which papers you wanna review decision on which papers to bid on will be largely influenced by titles that you're seeing is a good reminder that choosing a good title for your paper really help help to attract attention get people interested in your paper there like an advertisement for your paper tidal the a clear indication of what's going to be in the paper in a way that makes enticing title that is from this is a title that I used for my own experience it was actually not a title of a paper but there's a Toyota talk that I gave on time is on two aspects of the problem of natural language in terrible set about natural language inference ok aspects of the booking but which two aspects play why should I care we have no idea I mean actually never think about it is kind of like those underwear that are like things you should do to enhance your butt model to follow better example of a chat wildlife favourite tiles of a recent it's not NLP butter machine learning paper at nips in 2016 it was titled learn by gradient descent by gradient descent this was from Deep mine give me some of your read this paper this paper what about the title is you know what's going to be in that paper it's going to be about learning to optimise the gradient descent process itself what do you know what the papers about and know what you're going to learn from this paper and you know whether even be interested in this paper a little bit whimsical because it has this recursive structure in terms of recursion and when you take it away with making every title into a recursive title like title did both what is about somehow intriguing or with a twist or something appealing about it that's a great way to attract so order of Us in it on the bed on which papers they want to review the program chairs then assign reviewers who is actually read the papers readings and I'll tell you a lot more about the readings in just a moment then there's a response period so the on where is are allowed to respond to the reviews who is the comments from the reviews are sent back to the offers things to actually see the ratings and I'll see the comments that the reviewers have supply opportunity to respond for period of time diskin stimulating discussion amongst the reviewers is the first time typically that the reviewers are no longer anonymous to each other so there may be three different reviewers who have read a particular paper up until this point there anonymous to each other but now that identities are revealed the paper are still Anonymous in we don't know who they are but the reviewers be coming onto each other and you can have some interesting discussion around the paper the program committee does some magic to figure out get in to the conference in which one is due Barnsley based on the scores that have been assigned I will be more now about the scores reviewers are asked to assign scores for papers asked to evaluate on many different dimensions this is a list of typical used for ACL and I think other NLP conferences have left their like this but with minor variation me talk a little bit about each other this basically means is paper good fit for this conference does it sort of fit within the theme and the topics that are appropriate for this car that doesn't belong in this a low score for probate self-explanatory can you understand the people actually dead in this investigation replicability is a criterion that is growing in importance fibre 10 years ago people didn't really think about this that much more more it's becoming part of our community standard that results should be replicable replicability is making code and data available online so that others keep the experiment and see if they get the same results I think is pretty self-explanatory soundness and correctness where the well motivated decisions is are the things that I try with the things that I tried the right things to try to my sort of logical steps that I found in my investigation makes sense comparison play include comparisons to all of the work that I should have compared to is there work out there that's a very relevant going to be unaware of it where are related work or if you my quantity the results I don't need comparisons to closely related work try to explain everything I need to explain taronis can impair replicability if I haven't actually specified all of the details of all of the steps replicate my impact of ideas or results it's pretty resources this is particularly relevant if your work introduces a new dataset to the community might be of use to others can you sing a new dataset is not a problem meaning of anything wrong introduce a new dataset that's going to be valuable to the community help increase the the imp the overall recommendation which is undoubtedly the most important score it's sort of a intended to be a distillation of all the others scores should inform the overall evaluation scores in in typically they ask for a couple of other bits of meditative they ask do you write a review or do you recommend this work be presented as a poster in a poster session world presentation to as a talk more Prestige for an Oral presentation than a poster there's nothing wrong with presenting your work as a poster and it's a great way to get exposure for your working sometimes work as a poster is actually appealing because it facilitates discussion what sort of 1 and 1 discussion interested people sometimes by the way some conferences have both short and long oral presentation so long or presentation is typically a 20-minute presentation short oral presentations which are like 5 minutes or 7 minutes of course is an author you rather have a long form presentation in a short presentation and then I asked whether this paper should be considered as a candidate for best paper the conference will have at least 1 best paper word sometime still have like best paper overall and best in some countries have both 14 papers which are the eight pages you can mention that we look at before and also shorthorn papers pages you may have submitted a paper as an 8 page paper you might have an opportunity to say this one would be better as a short paper the bar is a little bit lower for sure ostrich otters no this is coming from the reviewers the program chairs will make the final determination on the best paper award but reviewers have the opportunity to effectively nominate a paper for consideration as the best that's something making the code base open source add within the code structure in itself what are the things that do things can you search people just making the code available which 10 years ago unfortunate was not in normal 20-years ago is not the norm put all the code on github I'm just putting the code on github huge proportion of what you need to do to make the code reproduce the adopting good software engineering practices and making sure that the curries readable another massive spaghetti that nobody you know possibly as well making available is by far the most important a slide with the names of some NLP conferences I want talk about YouTube turn off the the biggest and most reputable NLP conferences additional more focused on web and information retrieval here's a little bit more focused on and what about the topics the NLP like vision for example NLP tends to be important sort of sub current or sub-theme so if you're thinking about to bring a paper to a concert set the Light White I guess because I'm not knowledgeable about this tract of your paper is a little sizes your paper think about it is that an advertisement for your paper TV apps whether they want to make the Investment in Reading pa page paper can you read it to decide on whether to bid on to bid to review your paper like with the title you want the abstract to be both informative and engaging most of the same key elements that I described before Adam you're working on have enough room in the abstract to see why it's important problem with previous approaches have been employed I wanna say what your contribution is communicate the most important results of an evaluation in your abs why it seems abstract should summarise what are the key contributions of your paper should I as a reader be interested in learning find a way to do this in only about 100 words very concise polished like a like really valuable to get feedback from other people on your abstract whether they are clear and whether there's any way Blackmore play types advice on giving talks actually nothing new to say here this is kind of exactly what I said about writing a paper format is different 10 is going to be largely similar raging ape chef bull and has some great guidance for giving tax and that I encourage you to go read this is a very short he gives the site here is number 5 advocate not a defender from LA when you president you that on trial my dear it's some work and investigation and approach and model ticket price don't get wrapped up in it and if people question it don't take that as an attack on you go be part of it ok if the work is incomplete if the work has flaws create a belt dispassionate in your presentation of in its best light anything about it person helps to presentation ineffective Echoes this insight from from Patrick Blackburn is it worth a good tax come from from honesty about the work that you do honest you kind of can't go wrong representing the a little bit about slides and different styles of creating slides I have two very different approaches to creating slides one is approach approach approach Lidl maybe just a couple of words very quickly you threw them you like click click click click click as you talk look at the slides in isolation if somebody just gave me the deck but you didn't see the Euro presentation to understand because there's just a couple of words or maybe a diagram or something and it's like they tend to be more exciting and interesting by the way this slide is more like the maximalist approach the maximus approach has lots of words on a slide slower as you got through there give them in isolation they are lot easier to understand because all of the words or most of the words that you need are there on a slide the max must approach is that between reading the slide and listening to you in if you have words on the side when a slight first comes up there probably reading is like in there probably not listening to you pros and cons to these two different growth preparing to speak at WWDC next week and if you know anything about Apple Paul takes the minimalist approach we have I have like one word on them and they go at a pace of like one slide every 5 seconds or something like that graphics in a varied is no radiator the style that works for you and works for the content that you're trying to prove is valuable to think about the pros and cons Edward and Peter norvig has darts flattery Skyrim using if you want mundane things but there's a bunch of really good advice here it's really good to test your setup typical when you're presenting at a conference like five parks in a row before that there will be a break if you're presenting during that in the break before that block time didn't do that made that mistake and I spent I had 20-minutes from my talk I spent the first 5 minutes and my took fumbling with myself a room of 300 people like fumbling with my setup and it was incredibly embarrassing and then when I find it sorted my talk I was off flustered and I took was a disaster my mistake tester setup before you launch into attack so make sure you don't have any windows in the background with embarrassing stuff on it read that mistake but I've seen other people hurt me that period talk at a conference is 20 minutes and then usually 5-minutes for questions is really important because when you get feedback from the audience about more about Loren Grey questions in your question period especially for question you've really connected with your audience and their interests any questions you should be a little bit bummed out failed to get your audience interested in your top also scary no idea what's going to come out you can rehearse and rehearse and rehearse and feel really well prepared there is no way to prepare you just have to think on your feet and do your best do better if you really know your topic well but you will you have no idea what's going to come out Nations will come that you don't know how to respond to say I don't know talk to you more about this afternoon that can be a great opportunity to make a new connection in the research community that can lead to anything could lead to a future collaboration that is an opportunity as well couple tactical things about your presentation going to prepare a video presentation it's due on June 1-minute talk create a short deck in Google slides on PowerPoint or keynote for yourself through this day on a Mac using QuickTime or if you met on a Mac you have to figure it out people in the castle of helpful suggestions for a play the video to YouTube you can make a private if you want to send this to 5-minute video be in the video your face doesn't have to be in the video if it will just show your slides and an audio will be you talking through about that forehead dating advice online and then the world play text me like running after 2-hours and spit intense I don't have any specific strategy to suggest but I share your experience like I can page dents paper in one sitting typically Sophie to paper that means someone's all don't think it's that important for me to really get traduction carefully and then can I skim the rest I really want to go in one sitting vol I don't have any specific strategy play report live ok play Dubai turn head off at this point to meningitis going to be giving a presentation on data what is a documentation documentation I'm on the relevant date especially I'm really have a lot of examples what's 20 actually very pop people create new images by zoom download Dusit Renfrew talk about the actual a dog sentiment number of pennies 1020 usually the case this morning bro playing with them station how to print a document argument natural English training forearm the baseline is going to be that I am db1000 examples train Winchester? is the main thing of course give you stokke buggy de documentation my Wigan top into the very collect Edinburgh from fishing is something very similar replay flats to rent play main random the name of Nabi Rock Leone perform random swap we can swap mean with a sign delete a random word by using random delay the word Project necessarily preserve the original Lyon eap for actually rent phra that wasn't that's it reused and it 10000 more used to regression model 1.2% what better patient uses on Euro machine when you haven't back that back in the final project is the main kinda like a perfect version anything to me Rihanna is a major Tom work traffic you think will translator it's possible to create perfect version spectrum Google Translate API Xenon Beckenham combined two spectra that you could impose to original training data 1.8% last Lyon respect translation inhibition tda progression housing and then we trailer 81 increase from the baseline take me to put in patient turn down looking into you have a lot of that down to me is it always kind of way play Red Army seems that documentation is moron comprehensive hi everyone I'm OK love I'll be talking about bring back black box mornings today concept of probing is to be able to understand what models are actually doing it some sort of introspection technique talking specifically with regard to contactless word word embeddings and sentence embeddings but this is something which can be applied to a lot of other models as well like everyone heard about the opening igbt huge language model contextualize what a witches object language modelling but they do encode a lot of other information and it's really interesting to see how they include this information and be effectively applied to a lot more downstream definition of word Up robbing task is that it's a classification problem which Focuses on some simple linguistic properties of this this is an informal definition from this paper which is my Facebook out of are you recommending this paper if you want to architectures work and so my brother designed to evaluate to what extent the include the Sword of linguistic profit going to be very simple so that you don't have like interfering results you gonna by probing for something very specific Andy's Tobin architecturally instead they will be likely no transformation or LEGO tulio de Melo essentially the main idea is when you do have the sort of embedding representations you want to understand what sort of information day and Co some sort of classifier to learn this one control4 biases in disproven costing simple because you can't really control this and like the dance this is going to be an architecture which is agnostic of where do you get the same building representation you fill in my opinion because it babe not coming and one-third of trouble task which is designed certain properties can be applied to different models one example is undead you have a pre-training quarter with a Stranger on some object get someone Webster representation from the same folder and then you will be passing that through your program ordered and as already mentioned that the strawberry model is designed to be like really shallow like it's going to be like a 1-year transformation the end of this classification task based on what sort of linguistic properties are trying to in the style so today will be talking about to sort of plugs one is like sentence embedding probes and the other one is worthy I kind of want to highlight some of the my profile when you're looking at a sentence level vs A level sentence level and within you didn't you have them but you sentence level and bleeding from a wireless card or any other recorder with strange it can be machine translation it can be snli it can be skipped or scripted is a special time where your training this and codified neighbouring sentences there's a lot of literature on how encoders initialised with kind of bed they can also and code properties of the sentence of the word giving that you do get an end to pass a sentence through this and Corinne you get on everything properties you can clubs information can be everything have some sort of information about what the actual length of the sentence can you actually get information about what's the weather in the sentence syntactic information is weather on an encoder level with your town or understand whether these encoders actually sensitive to some semantic information giving a sentence if I swap to buy Loctite and I pass it through my and cold is going to be sensitive to the swap or not symantec is for example the stents you can find the tense of the I actually like the last us with this amount Accord Minolta Square basically what you doing can you please a noun or a word randomly with another now another one but the currency of the download Twitter swapped out is similar to the original word and when you do pass it through so you're trying you're trying to see if the sentence is the sentence everything is just based on superfish electone frequency properties or is there actually and putting some form of context is the probe is like the context place weddings which seems to be I have been happening the clipboard on opening retreating the same idea about a pro it's just so when I say contactless word and buildings are very because in glove it would be like 1 week 24 one word with contactless well and buildings is can you do a sentence you get like a word and meaning for every talking based on the counter in authentic idea is the same simple model witches play some sort of linguistic information and this is a simple model then you can infer that this information is actually included in these word and buildings and property off the sum of doepfer a word level meeting is better health centre confirmation again the name 90 recognition I'm talking to whether you can actually get like the dependencies between the Stoke meaning of giving a sentence you want to induce like a free structure on it whether you can identify a sign of talking as a workplace or a noun phrase commission is basically anything you can get from worn out like what about the the semantic rolled entailment concrete news Dakota extraction sort of thing you can talk for it like local and long-range dependencies like if if you were to take the task of dependency labelling Dawkins Whitchurch the part and giving tokens which Alec 10 words apart can you still identify the dependency that would be like a fine grain check weather like long-range dependencies are actually included in these contactless world talk with morbid robbing them sending somebody's and probing them but this is something which needs to be applied or can be applied to any of the I guess I'm coming back to the word representation you're trying to see water encourages and fittings but another spaces water of information is not you're trying to analyse patient does it include more is it sintactico tonight if it was language modelling you can have different objectives for language modelling but it's interesting to see how if you were to encoder Centre how does that representation baby with a different objective elanga I want to take an Alicia as a language Marley and then I heard a bunch of players in my list encode the same sort of information or different information how do I effectively what's the source of information from my in corridor to my downstream tool lower layers including most synthetic information and higher layers in encoding mode semantic information which talks about you want to do like ok has a bunch of layers and the same sort of non follow that the lower levels emotion tactic and the higher levels last night if you want to improve on downstream tax if you want to be with them as out of the bar average of days emblems would be nice away than just using one of the layers in talking watch later and coldwater information I think this doing a task force a machine translation then you can see how you see 26 model objectives can be changing how this normal in Cordova foreign property based on the objectives just not listed properties but any if if you're training occurred a deep neural architecture seems to be better but you need to you need to have integratable models you need to understand why morals are doing the way they are and there's a good place to start off what sort of English information do they captured is it just you demanded that is it something heading property off the ark I guess I just want to finish off by saying is been done and can be done in this whole probing Selecta because it's a trade-off between what sort of tools do you want to probe what sort of Architecture do you want to do you want to use and what sort of hypothesis do you want to test there's a lot of Need for integratable th of March nice place to explore especially for your partner projects to see giving that you train your model to improve and some sort of evaluation metric been trained on or is it doing something else as well yeah thank you before don't know much about it but neural networks do-si-do service a strong baseline dining room need to see with regard to contact lens Reading Reading from the encoder does on par with like happening that way I maybe we can talk about it also research online ability at weddings latest book cancel is inherently including some form of what percent is being trained on it does inherently in Cork the one on the property against you can you could actually do Toyota play from my understanding I think Elmo specifically designed for more information than Samantha lights on semantic role labelling information it does to better locate synthetic turf you a stabbing that doesn't know he's your tongue gloves does well on that task who's been in court at the moment from what time in quite a lot and long-range dependence in the something which is encoded but
