the brave Souls here and person thrilling report the talk about Bake Off 3 if you've already forgotten we doing was developing the best relation extraction systems we possibly could very multi-class problem in we're looking at F1 I'm in the best sister I have the results from about 100 different models here to where are simple bag-of-words feature Rise or baseline was from the homework you can see this is very exciting post office managed to BS1 that's great sing we use rvsm code to analyse the can use to see if we can find any trends case it's really noisy so we're going to skip this instead look at something else little bit more anecdotal but we did we went through the top 15 and bottom 15 tried to draw patterns of the commonality the top performing systems I think the biggest trend is features seems to be a lot more productive than caring about your model or your marlin architecture so systems here we can see here 6% of the top systems used just a simple logistic regression the other 33% used to random Forest and really it was in just the wealthy voluminous ft arises where that really distinguish the top system it's kind of fun skating through because it's like I'm playing mad libs with the words left right middle directional pause by Graham and trigram so you can kind of convertify pick 3 combined times.in you have a really good sister I definitely combining different kinds of features was was the biggest left so on average the top 15 systems had 5 ft arises compared to the bottom ones which generally decided so I think that that shows that you can kind of get along a bit pretty Fire by thinking about what are the info for the very top system congratulations to this group you can see here we have and this is like 10 different 10 different feature Rises this group include some glass as well in this kind of on repeated runs write the main just above second place also had a nice long list of feature Rises but main difference here being and did not include glove this is Visa good is a good numbers here the last magnificent magnificent magnificent systems there is more exploration of different modelling model types of some people try different you know classifiers are different like an SPC or something play just a very short list of feature Rises it was it was fun to see in some of the top systems how there is like tons and tons of code trying all the different models that was just ultimately a vendor model factory from the home loud looking for the systems a lot of creativity and I think we can all go to sleep proud that we as a group have leader bassline that's all resolutely so thanks for really fun big off and you know one more to go you don't have that Arsenal and it looks like it's probably about .65 London maybe I'm being way too generous here that was just the number one I ran you should have done it more maybe I'm I'm too optimistic you said that again maybe the big spike years ride around the Bassline a couple of times will see where start the show that's great reposing in just saying Forest Monster posters up on Tata why do you have really invested in the systems that you produced for this for Bake-Off and for people who did that proud I mean you've worked out in a deep way on for very different problems and I know you which is me deep analysis than other courses off accomplishment right you've got real expertise now in in those four different prob have you have subsist all of these make off switches again very impressive play that's the final one for us and then we're moving to a more project oriented about Dad in the coming weeks the film review after the Bake Off is the next thing that's do that's do on may 13th the guideline side about what that should contain we could look at them now just in case there any Quest paper doing a group one of the final project groups on Theatre to do that so that credit to sign in the way that you expect when should you five papers groups of 2 should have 7 groups a379 so that does numbers they are kind of encouraging you to work in a large tired but you have to do overall less work in terms of reviewing papers if you do that nothing I want to stay here it's just that Manchester lit review so it is also attempting to push you to begin thinking about what problem you gonna take play that given the timer loaded the ideal thing is that over the next week or so you and your group on a Prague changing a midstream there just isn't a lot of time to do that and I feel like that leaves you behind so you should try to figure things out now and then just go forward with that plan this is meant to sort of encourage you to start that problem solving cos we want for the papers that you chose no problem is good creative after wave kind of summarising what you studied some concise summary Ruby doing there is trying to tease out maybe the major contribution getting to 3 here is there a like weather differ they're starting to fall down with with gaps with his obvious room for it's an order paper and you know about some newer models that would be worth trying on the tour obvious thing to point out because that might start to point out the outlines of the project ultimately want to do hello Siri say hello this is the most valuable this could be the basis for the B review section cuz in the paper that you write for the live view section the go there is not too princess contextualise your work justify the modelling choices that you made contractors going to lay the groundwork for doing that I would say but you want to give real site free future work suggestions for how these papers could be extended if you do that in a thoughtful way discussion place for you and your teaching team mentor because your mentor can go in Sale the first one is resolved but the second one is absolutely worth pursuing baby too hard so why don't you think about 2 is kind of a guiding thesis for your work on the project right that's an incredibly productive thing that could have play seriously about for this should I have a proper references section were going to be picky about that you will do some credit if you don't have a proper bibliographies and again like that's going to carry through all these assignments I think it's just part of scholarship we're not picking about the format for this morning but we are picking that you have a proper baby with your team the do you try to use it as a chance to lay the groundwork for your next document for the final project is the experimental protocol is recalling requirements for that renew them right now except to say that this is part of Us continue in the direction of having a qualitative analysis that uses day encoded in this whole project structure and the protocol is going to be a kind of check in magical succeeded that way and that you're also doing the right things in terms of setting up bass lines and that you have the problem once you've done that I think you're really have your paper in terms of experiments and Ivory nothing after that are more presentation also a video we dive into the material talk about grounded language understand favourite topic for Nou this is kind of when we finally start to realise what you might think of is the true dream for nlu which is like that you'd have a robot friend or something grounding here is just because I do think the difficult to achieve that goal of have how can I have to exist in kind of social physical environments in some sense or at least be a tune to the in such environments I think they will not all they have done is experienced text flying through them and maybe producing text to substantiate that claim a little bit but I think it's pretty intuitive that a big part of the human experience adjusting physical and social situations in Leverage a lot of that information brings me back to the fact that if our systems are going to six grounded in his ways and so what I tried to do is just a symbol building blocks productive be used to start to design systems that are ground Alexa I'm going to suggest some ways in which even if you don't think of your problem is a grounded Nou prob is that you could bring in some of that grounding in there by in richer system in terms of its performance but maybe also just in terms of why is that you could conceptualize your this is a linguist words I'm going to give you some history talk about speakers agents that observes and non-linguistic thing and produce a linguistic expression listener is an agent that consumes prints of some kind about the world come together in chatbots I want emphasize there is that I think for a chat but to succeed again they need to be doing something it's grounded and something language external if they're just 430 Cheddar with no purpose or goal succeed at doing anything like what we want them to grounding there play gets most pragmatic when we talk about reasoning about other Minds this would be how I could be more and more effective user of land not just about production or comprehension but also about what it's like when I'm on speaker what is like to be a speaker that can enrich the system that you're using it can fill a lot of the gaps in terms of as we exchange with each other is it the something deep about about kind of efficiently learning from data that's another angle and I'm going to try to convince you when we talk about this things that I didn't really some of this history this is a slight idea that I'd Store from engine McCallum he just encourages us to thing stop the movie 2001 because you could think of that movie making predictions about three things in terms of technology what bra graphics will be like in the year 2001 Tudor chess playing in 2000 about any of you robot hell very natural open ended conversations with you cross spot Studios comparison that they show for hell 20930 evenwell before 2001 we had things like Jurassic Park case weather creators of this movie play failed to imagine how rich the future would be right this is it spell of failure of imagination that this is what computer graphics would be reality we made a lot more progress than expected what's playing they got it exactly right so how the on-board computer replaced just before that in terms of actual human history deep blue beat Garry Kasparov press of that they more listen they are the kind of timeline in dialogues have you seen the movie you can see that how has these incredible human like conversations with humans and it's not just that it has these conversations but that they are obviously like and deeply grounded in this this in house goals season fact conspiring against him for his own purposes and self-worth but these are incredibly rich into 14 doors showed us what this would like so this is the dream for Siri you not quite approaching when helping to achieve but maybe at least I can get my tacos order do something Google show us the funniest get from Stephen Colbert which just show the the gap what Stanley Kubrick imagines and what we actually realise that I mean because I give you compare little chest right in the middle tuam anlu overstating what we would actually achieve and I think that comes back to the fact that language of feels after something that we ought to be able to master and infect like all throughout the history of ar you have people they're just on the verge of solving all these problems that I kind of see now that on or programming in scheme or now deep learning these things are just about to solve all these problems got to be elusive those turn out to be harder than we imagine can a trader eliminate part of why that quotes from Terry weiniger keys into the surrounding ideal language is action all language used can be thought of as a way of activating procedures within the healer there's a program causes a set of operations to be carried out within the years called the keys into the goal oriented nature of the way of conveying Ty this problem is persistently more difficult than people think I thought I would present this analogy that I used when I teach semantics and pragmatics as well it's comes from the linguist Steven Madden imagine does a Rembrandt sketch here is there for a second that you can even if you've never seen it before kind of make out that there's a figure in the centre people kneeling at the feet Centre Archway or something some kind of building is in the background additional context for Rembrandt sketches or four sketches like even make the inference that this is a Christ figure in the was around right you probably have other images in mind that kind of resemble when is that this is incredible if you really look at this guy realise that it is just the barest outline of all of them rich stuff that you're able to infer I mean it is incredibly sketchy level of detail it's like a random collection of wine we are geared as humans to be able to take those random squiggle call that richness from and you do that kind of multiple layers rights how much contacts you can infer that there's a figure turn off social and cultural can't Christ figure and if you know something about Rembrandt like this could get arbitrary interpret that picture your drawing on much more than just the wrong visual image there you are able to imbue it with lots of other miracle about human vision in the computer stuff that goes along is the other interpretation is very much like at much more information from their audiences and seems to be encoded in US incredible amount of kind of what you might call reading between the lines ring out from somebody's very sketchy other in in the girls who take them to have and what you know about them is people you're able to inform much more than was just directly encoded there information that you extract directly from what's included but rather from all of that other stuff working in conjunction please said to you just like here the Lions tell only this very small part of the full story about what you extract the natural that's what you do if the image is akin to the Natural that's what you do when you interpret people's ordinances or when you expect others to ensure your references you don't prefer shops that people are selling then to underestimate just how hard that is front Nou problem come away a very quickly and just how much encoded in the Lang LG alarm you'll be really easy you know for rogue barcode language understanding would be really easy when was limited to what a coded in a language that we actually order with each other the language itself would be incredibly at least it would be easy for machines just like those Park Audi is that so much I think that in the end agent chicken have an agent that has lots of other human a few of these things just a kind of random collection of things that I like from pragmatic that sort of point at how hard this problem is good with what language cartoon Dexter cows the indexical here is the obvious one is the first person pronoun I that's a pretty easy problem to solve have some kind of ground I mean obviously if you've just got text coming in and out then figuring out when I'm bizarre questions to ask do you think about today's devices like your phone that you might have a pretty sophisticated you have already like the phone could just at some level know that I is the Creed correct a lot of the time best free sophisticate easy queso what about we won meaning of we probably to include the speaker show collection of people that it refers to context depend are you my mum I support could be the people in my community still in my country every way that you could possibly imagine the skull volume up from first to third person working fronted with essentially all the problems of pragmatic maybe the Aires easy but what about the here not going to be interpreted this planet Earth because that's not such an informative thing to say in 2019 I am here will be ring mahira first to find it we are here pointing at a map credible kind of abstract visual depiction transfer to the physical ok Al Capone on here now this is a wonderful example from linguistics and Philosophy of language but I'm not sure that people use this anymore cos they're no phones in there for no answering machines but in the old days machine might say I am not here now little puzzle beak the current speaker is not in the place local borough after work this has the challenges of wee and I was just highlighting hear that adjectives like low IKEA it's heavily context-dependent and highly variable in terms of exactly what kind of thing it refers cancel expressions like this three days ago is indexical on the time of ordering some terms Hugo tomorrow now work in a similar way and now small words only way that you can get a grip on and then of course you see that they pragmatic context-dependent where you from question for me I think about this all the time because when people ask me am I never know what sense they mean do they mean Connecticut where I was born prime citizen is my affiliation a planet Earth again nobody asked Dad but maybe will it live in an exciting future will they do this is coming from where this example is it's a kind of mundane question but already you can see that it keys into the goals that the speaker something about you is determined by the goal pause might be kind of undetermined I feel like when people ask this they often don't know what kind of information are you hoping to get bashing you have dance about whether you resolved the issue that's an added layer of complexity on top of the fact means I have to know what your goal is Adam fires that sophisticated didn't see any this is kind of King into ellipsis but also what language got quantifier domain so either typos in my slides I didn't see any bookstores downtown I didn't see any the cupboard I didn't see any right there's no way I'm going to get a grip on this other it's me at least what the proceeding discourse context is within you also have to do some really sophisticated stuff about figuring out to expand the meaning of this electrical phrase it has two layers of complexity first I have to figure out talking about also have to do some domain everyone entering the Bake Off ruin in the universe effortlessly figure out that when I say everyone in this car I can't text if I use it in my house or my depart Time Christmas being as office €10 Christmas dinners offer modals have a kind of September jewellery this one is epistemic deontic so this one is coming into Norwich here you're offering you're ever seven cities in this offer the sensitive keys into laws of the Campus in this case this is the relevant role different senses this is pervasive in Langley it's not just as this auxiliary can insured but also in advert figure out what these statements mean is figuring out is lots of different flavour example if kangaroos have no tails they would fall over true but about there jetpacks able to insert dad into the kind of counterfactual reasoning that goes into this conditional here then it feels false right it wouldn't follow in the world's would have jetpack how you know not to consider that possibility until I introduce your judgement about the truth of the State the flexibility of your reasoning is counterfactual situ the fact that you didn't really reflect on it when I gave you the important to be able to do that to figure out what these claims are that I love this to box I think they're real Harvard Business School Harvard Business School what's the master for contain the sum total of all human knowledge thinking like a tradition cancel both of these titles I guess is that there is implicit domain restriction on these what's here and it's complement in the floor space of all the things that can be knowable are they both have taken on a much more refined expressions this is another kind of grounding left and right front and back former and Latter and this was the case for somebody's confused about perspective this is from the website you had one job using the stairs state of the right when going upstairs at the left-hand going down this will keep people from running into each other the kind of summarise this I have this statement many students met with me yesterday informal way I just highlighted all of the ways in expression you need some grounding in the physical contexts is the saddest what's the time of others time is temporal expressions speaker for me contextual restriction on students which made of distance here what's the time and then you do other kind Gracie and pragmatics like if you said men does that mean it's false that all the most the relevance of Stephen cancel it's about that before I switch here's a little bit that's a quick run through my greatest hits of phenomenal for that you could take 138 with already I know something love about understand the head fully internalize this message that I just sent about the importance of RAM has from the beginning these systems were grounded in in particular physical space influential paradigm case of this is Terry Wogan to video that kind of depends whether this was life for basically it was a a blox world in which things could be moved what a very finite domain issue instructions into this world and then the blocks would be manipulate that first of all it's just that from the start these dialogues with the system were fully grounded in that in that world looking actual examples of things that the system could do just how much at somewhere averaging the fact that was grounded in the the Boston Tea you can only make sense of if you know what you and you listening I can figure out what the speakers intended referent for the box the blue pyramid is the same way it's supported by that kind of enough for it to order and to their the same boxes as one blocks are not in the box again that's and that's a very difficult question to make sense of unless you're grounded in an environment them is referring back to blocks YouTube you all these things only way any system dialogue like this and perform these actions and answer these questions if it was crap 121 are the contribution that Ariana Grande made early on that I think still influence about Nou dentist called Weiner grade sentences for ski who's won the trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because figure out that means the suitcase and the reasonable do that is because you have an ability to kind of simulate mentally what is objects are like and how they related to each other which is coming from the fact that you live in a physical world and you have a lot there's the suitcase where fit into the Brown suitcase because it's too large the same kind of reasoning about physical refuse the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence hoofield violet it's account because of your understanding about social roles and there little bit the council refuse the demonstrators a permanent because they advocated by flights to the Dam define is very physical in its grounding in the second one is grounded in more like social can't very difficult problems I should have checked on this but at least as a recently list of 100 sentences even very sophisticated deep learning models were more or less performing at chance really hard and continue to work hard to find things that can solve these problems back to the real answer desiccated in robust I'm from another thing we could do is just take our queue from developmental psych is a field that is all about it's about humans lessons about the sand after all humans are best language learners by far in the universe as far as We Know word meaning for example with incredible speed we will certainly nothing like the amount of input that you would get for a model that even models that you've trained in this class the evidence suggests that they use it's inherited in the kind of ways that forms contrast with each other but also social cues about the speakers goal and regularly is in the physical information that you would get from looking just for example co-occurrence depend prices for Nou as I said human children are by far the best all for us intractable without grounding or solvable with the right kinds of ground low cases of Corona won't get tracks like that understand about the Blacks the bright spot for the change of a recent years so deep learning systems are really flexible toolkits for reasoning about lots of different kinds of information in a single model I think LED the some real breakthroughs when it comes to grounding because after all think about grounding is I mean have some for my work what's I have doctor's for the people in my invite vector representation of this image with this video very models are happy to say I'll take your word representation video representation weather in do something into it's a very productive way to think about how you might the evidence and use it to make a decision data setting develop data said that you can do that I think your system will get better because at one level or Another let me use with each other is ground switch off the strip edit like the something Rich about language a video of the necessary in order to go along with data sets what I'm saying right which you say you could say no system is going to get traction on your suitcase example with the trophy yes I also show it lots of image that's incorrect but maybe that's a no Direction and that would reinforce my narrative which turn the lamp they're in this other kind set a reminder I worked on that intuition so unusual for somebody to describe the fact that the computer in a room is on the desk that's the most mundane thing ever it's the default assumption if I describe the room to you I might not bother to mention and I might just say there's a computer and you infer that it's on a desk put on the floor that I would bystander have for describing never learn the defaults One Answer might be that it can consume visual Ronaldo's describe that will be one the ladybirds One Direction also baby shark object and the object work out that simulated Mars never put Canada they're the grounding in my all this information that would get you over maybe the hurdle of default things not being described Derby speakers low-level now because partly what I want to do is empower you to be able to do some experiments and also think scientifically is useful to start small I mean no surely dialogues are really ambitious get more traction is there a kind of work control of what I'm going to talk about your see that a lot of this is going to be about cholera what's the best for reference peak for a few reason so we have wonderful datasets for this because it's an interesting kind of Grey are the complexity of Visual scene turn cells are cognitively complex and also pretty important to us how much that you get for describing colours is ahsoka constrain people to a colour for caviar Turning Point the guy behind xkcd he did a colour survey where he just ask people that describe colour massive dataset with millions of instances of people describing colour example from the very simple things like green and purple laptop tullamore poetical turquoise rare 15 Moss Green play play Blue already some domain knowledge creeping green is not a phrase I'd ever heard before green is a classic example from the state of said there's lots of puke colours in the dataset that security one I mean like we have a wonderful playground of reference which people produced in response is also very first Mallow to think about here is my most basic speaker listen is kind of encoder-decoder there are frameworks that I'm sure you best of heard about conversion of models you might have seen I'm going to send it what comes in is like an RGB representation of the Colour so just three floats happens to be hsv play kind of color representation comes in give me something to in bed that colour like some kind of transformation of it to make it higher dementia map that into a hidden representation which I'll call the colour representation than orange encoder part this is a very simple and colder which might be just tool that produces the cinema order part for speakers is more interesting so DreamWorks is we just assume that generator start symbol that's where they begin to speak an embedding represent produce a hidden representation which is a function of the Colour representation and you weren't with chain them together with this Redline these two have to have the same dimensionality Appleby the initial hidden state decoder how to make a prediction was here this is a kind of salty with whatever it is dark a prediction that is a probability distribution over the entire hi dimension I do that can take some getting used to it the kind of miracle that this works because it is a classifier but it's a classifier into this incredibly high-dimensional space eir signal so in the data might be that the first word is light for the scholar that were describing down someone having coded vector and you get a standard coronavirus embedding representation coming from these guys distribution maybe like with a softmax classifier Harris this teacher training at the top because even though we produce the word is light teacher training here we just make light the next word we look up it's in bedding presentation from H1 and EX37 show me make another pretty what's the eir signal we did a good job there look up it's in bedding condition we predicted Green to do is to stop to produced produced the stop signal so that's another error signal for the model and in teacher forcing stop even though it didn't produce generalization of our model 4NL right where you can handle I was just look at the final output state that's where we going the label on every turn I'm getting used to is this teacher forcing ideas a wrong prediction here we insert the correct predict practice for new trainees Meadows I guess best practice is kind of to make some teacher forcing more exploratory work wear the mall did the wrong thing dark is the night for a wider part of training works and then time again a colour comes in that's what's given to us bedding in a representation just go on her own the rights to produce this predict making predictions when we hear reproduce how many of you have seen this models before on the one hand it looks just like the aniline when you think through her training has to work and her prediction have to work a twist here the way you use the predictions as in if you wanted for example to implement this stand the pytorch aniline provided with women Rohan No Good Men a few years ago we did exactly this model using xkcd dataset we did a fourier transform to get our initial represent another trick that we did is so the mother wouldn't forget what colour it helps the colour representation to Oliver remember that you're trying to describe this particular colour and I think that helped in the expected Way by tomorrow that would describe colour turn my side effect of working in a simple domain what's the big crazy in neural language mod a lot of analytic insights about what it was doing by looking at its representations in colour like we can give it as many colours as we want and see what things that the resulting representations in you could see you like the Headland that greenish typically excludes Green in a kind of interesting fundamentally we just one when do multi word colour images there for you with a sandal I've got images you get captions sizemore hasn't been Twist more interesting corpus so again with Will and some people here at Stanford Robert Hawkins and Noah collected this colours in contacts the different in the sense that instead of describing colour patches in isolation 73 colour patches which one was their target to describe 20th what was the day succeeded to the extent that could figure out from the same context which one was there we've got some simple expressions in these very easy to distinguish contacts blue purple Green blue this year weather to blues darker blue one that's great scared of the dark blue opposite reference to the fact that there are two very similar colour patch words for said the Tudor Moorgreen Venus colour is in this person was like very explicit about picking out that turn off the super bright one the regular greens very rich context purple and blue play the same colour patch see that depending on the context they were in people describe that colour 6 thing about colours that even your perception of them can be someone influenced by in the space in here you see that reflect simple speaker that does the summoner return to the smaller but even this baseline is interesting where you just have it recolour the same space designated like maybe the one closest to the end is the target describe this Mallow is colour descriptions that are text sensitive in the way that I do team Trick of reminder target related ideas think of what I just showed you with call describe case of image capture I'm guessing you guys heard about it was revolutionised a few years ago in part by research associate stand for by inna having these capsules be generated by an all included those models the encoder part is typically much more involved when I just showed you all we had to do is in bed to embed arbitrary complicated in basic structure is the same you know do some processing to your input object and then produce some like anticipate contact saying there a couple of papers from these groups at Google image captioning actual tasks of the intuition there is free pictures of buses I say bus bus bus from my cap really might want there is captions that distinguish the three what is a model that has some incentive to sale double decker the contacts in the computer build informative in that context will need tomorrow only just kind of more open in here visual question answering that's a task where you given an image and a question whether you have to produce what I would call and grounded answer is there any literature on turn off bedroom text say to choose the context in which that others would have been needed to distinguish Harrogate but the entire can't ok which one of these when you need to do the one that one that one a very interesting thing to think about is another perspective if I say the darker blue when you learn that are too blue you're saying that for this when you were the whole lot about what the whole context need to be presuppositions that you have speakers will do in you could use the scriptures to get some tracks on image generation from the caption have a few references princess for that yeah that would be like listeners again you can have the same dataset people have done this same task formulation will have this colours in contact thing now description like light blue standards for the foreigner will be the crucial hidden state show me some transformations on that hidden state to kind of move yourself into colour space you're trying to do is your giving this contacts and it says 12-in targets imagine this one is the target want your agent to pick some kind of transformation in work that I've done we've done it for you trans Orange use this hidden representation or some statistics derived from the score for each of these elements of your can't scores can be fed into a softmax classifier that finally decide this was actually the target a bit more involved because of the structural nature of the space on the Harley do a born-again colours are cool because please make some simple assumptions about what is patient should be like the weather set a framework here even a simple classifier in my terms as a kind of listener write it you consume some language like a document or an inner layer until the Paris about a movie inference into a structure simplest version of this and the other extreme the models that girls going to talk about on Wednesday like semantic parsers where language maybe a very sophisticated latent representation of that Lang prediction into a highly structured help 14 just showed you for example is like scene generation so the task of nothing from language representation of visual c is that dude it runs through them is what you actually do is nap from language into like an attribute value structure of an other process produce some of these aspects of the highly structured output space to get be really interesting like in this and colleagues language u-value descriptions that could be fed into Henry visual scene general is really rich is another point paper this is the image flicker 30K paper from Julia hockmeyer and hers dos2 learn visual denotations for can you the way you are task is that the speakers in a list of disconnected that we have your data set at training a speaker Jack and we also have the colours on the listeners to go now also some research on just like end and like a speaker is generating home message that is that then ring lights that's great I will be like a chat bot if I don't if the model you have mine is different from when I shown describe and my picture will be there chat but should be grand extended tide of neural chatbot setup where agency WhatsApp is like in representation you have the sprayed into another iron in the decode cast with producing utterances and it doesn't in exactly the way that my stayed in the car meaning insult what's the work on this lot of it came out of Stamford I think a lot of progress has been made on this problem but I do think that you're kind of fundamentally how tall is doing is lots of dialogue tags what is browning is always going to limit the ability of this chapter make a lot of privacy real consistent in the other answers getting them to but they don't degenerating to just saying I don't know where I hate one of the ways that he overcame some of these limitations were with when I was called grounding so for example consistency so that they wouldn't in one dialogue turn say that they are and then the next day they had no children did like user embeddings for the different age turn off of an anchor to enforce a lot of the can you hear isn't even richer for my ground in this will be like task-oriented this is grounded in a really wonderful couple of papers that came from the Facebook AI group the first paper is called dealornodeal new releases dataset of about 6000 dialogues that are grounded Munich scene to the interface this is agents that are trying to negotiate on a trade of some of Jackson this agent they've been valued differently so the book has a value of value of 0 is giving a subset of them so this agent has one 0 balls that they're playing with has a similar or a different a different set of the odd is that they want to maximize the reward play sleep set up because single scenario tents what is the both of them can walkway completely happy there has to be some actually look like it's kind encoded for a hue Z4 you're neuromod representation for the two perspectives Ewan respect you just appears saying that you have one book with 04 hatsworth 2 and 1 ball worth cancel all dialogue after the Strain I don't want I resemble a missing code zero Ward you agreed to it and then finally down here that's a representation of the go function for the other eye dogs in the dataset that they released all paired like this so this was you respect dialogue how comes different goal function in a first this was the you one that I showed you before in or prospect because of his different golfer to go to clarify about the task complexities that generated really turn up with a book next check do to remember the ordering of these things up here that's why I put these reminder looks like obviously there's a huge amount of information but I think it a high level you can get the gist of what they're doing so of Ireland they happen to use this gr encoder they're just in codes in its own embedding space and potonion representations the goal here like 10421 they showed you before object value what is HG this will be an important state because you're seeing in other places in them that the agent has consumed that go represent dialogue and coda is doing is just I kind of chatbot which reducing language does that HG get a pendant to Aldi's talking to you again colour thing it's a kind of reminder about what the goal was in this up there for the output encoder this is a kind of nested stop this attention mechanism captured the gist of it so for the output encoder here it's 1 x-102 x 2 that's the conjunction of these representations down here their own bidirectional rnn which is fed through these attention appears again through the summary represent concatenated with the summary representation from all this attention representation is the basis for a bunch of different classifiers 1 and 2 number of and after the snuggles I'm going on here but the high level summary would be like recording of your goal log agent Enduro classifier different outputs interesting thing which I returned to but just at a high level is kind of small who is the train to age fix one another agent can interact with that first fixed one and start upgrading it agent as-11 were training at reading the goal add some dialogue be the sixth one response ascent is agents go back in agent a classification thing and get a reward do a reinforcement learning thing a feeling that reward back through the parameters for a human data potentially agente could get influencer agency could be a hue the train very nice inside from the paper even this agent here is not especially well grounded certainly this one is just kind of operating in a world of language and representation can you send the reward the word come is this thing that they called dialogue how the negotiation is going to go words bad back through and it helps them make a local decision feels like a Markov decision state is about the future get a reward different times and pick the the state highest expected reward play nice because then you're making very reduce of the rewards negotiate first high-level summary I do encourage you to look at the paper from more details there's just one more thing that's fun that I wanted to say about using median there about this paper without even realising so far that you've heard about it rodent passage during reinforcement learning an agent a attempts to improve its parameters from conversations with another agent Baker by a human Airfix supervised model that was trying to imitate what fixes we found it updating the premises of both age emergence from humans servicenow had a blood pulse which is also pretty what about this s models fixed because the researchers has found it updating the premises are both age from human language develop their own language for English music read a file on their Facebook overlord make up their own language to do things faster football players have short in names for certain place instead of taking the time in the Huddle to describe where everyone should find Aldi but at least the first sight part of this is pretty clear side It's Not Unusual for baths to make up a lingo that humans can't comprehend still worries about these things play gossip about it behind her back what did the code to make the but stick to playing in still pretty good as a report about what they did different tech times Facebook was forced to shut down one of its artificial intelligence systems after researchers discovered that had not that it started communicating in which they could not understand examples unpause they're alive I'm me meatball Haywards at the head discovered on their own it is kind of interesting to think that for these agents that might be a meaningful negotiation move and maybe recouped out by that but I think this is coming over blown it doesn't stop there the incident evokes images of the rise of Skynet in the Iconic Terminator series Tesla CEO Elon Musk is right about AI being the biggest risk we face overblown problems here's a bunch of other datasets some of these are pretty card but there are also instances of doing task-oriented dialogue what I wanted to do I can at least give you a flavour for this this is what I called reasoning about other Minds motivating example which reminds you of Grace if you've read price mystery agency referring to these 2-cylinder who's going to say the blue one this one on the decision is thinking my listener knows that I'm Co-operative in the Gracie and sensing what that really means it's just that find a communicate in an open and honest way and my listener Knowsley we know the both of us can leverage information about the contacts then what we know about being human and so forth in order to figure out what how to work out that I mean the unmarked blue on the idea there is that since you just said blue and not something like a baby the unmarked where does s ambiguous swimming that the speaker was corrupted that's this kind of collective social thing if I assume that they have picked them artform like baby blue the time in the Ben more informative than that way with an audience they would have been and they were assimilate mind meld this will be completely different in this context the blue one this is the same colour blue the right here dynamica trying to capture all these thought bubbles fr systems could do this at some call Mother for doing that it's called the Rational speech X model it was developed by people hear it stand for hierarchy of three probabilistic age listener here iMessage some language do they speak Lex that message in that language makes a guess about with the world is that based on a prior over the world Justice core lexico information which you could think of is kind of just using your knowledge of them part about this is that we have a pragmatic speaker in this model observe the world in the gruesome because that I showed you before is that the speaker does this based on the literal list information about how costly different nothing here is that the speaker reasoning directly about the Lang Liverpool veterinary reasons about one layer of indirection and already there communication system then you would have had if you were just reading a does pragmatic listen here you have two layers and directions observes a message about the world play by reasoning about the prior over Worlds deliveroo Panamera no start bubbles where it was imagine I'm a speaker and then I can work it out on speaker side as well this model however you like here is that if you're a pragmatic listener or pragmatic speaker you don't reason just about the conventions of your agents were using you get a dish simple just a very simple case you have two messages beard and glasses Louis with his magnificent beard he was a flat Grace magnificent beard at this time in his life but they both have glasses true true false travel if you are a listener and you heard beer the glass unambiguous for you right away this is true both is Anthony so if you heard just a random guess about which of these two entities that the speaker was I kind of mechanical warm that speaker calculator check the register surprisingly I have an unambiguous sis Toulouse beard follows from the fact that if I want to refer to progress down here my only option what's the sign of go one layer further first to leave have a beard but notice that 50/50 is now 2575 bias in favour of you in glasses just like that dynamic I showed you before we just metallising the idea that wanted to refer to luas with beard and since I didn't you must mean you must be probability bayesian model tomorrow it's been incredibly successful in linguistics inside experimental evidence that people are doing something like this calculation problems in pragmatics for salt quietly by the snow like a computer science now that work you have a hand specified lexicon can you perform that speaker calculation literally learn about every possible alternative message that could produce language like English is not even a final very high by a smile because I can specify this and there's no learn chances to learn at for example Force a beard for David Bowie in Context corpus is a setting in which we can think about this as a machine learning problem it's too large for a hen specified lexicon think about the speakers and listeners I showed you before and where they could solve this what's Michael phone Daryl speaker is the one I showed you before s0 uses the context assumes the contacts and produces a disc listener is the one that I showed you before language context makes a guess about what the the weather all agents the ones that we would have had specified in the previous no please can a black box no more the simplest version of this model you could just apply that RC calculation on top of those two ages speaker turn on that with a listener which is the neural listener I showed you instead of having to worry about all the conceivable tolerances that are alternative to one the one that was chosen speaker approximation of distance not your problem solve the pragmatic listener location of the RSA calculator this ass way train models calculation and presumably you better at this a time you but I wanted to mention also that solving this problem here is the just change the space of atomic messages and that's all my stuff we did what we call pragmatic image cap dimension from the Google Groups before wide RC to a standard image captioning sis instead of sampling from s0 reasons to apply the RCN reasoning step at the level of individual character leads to better and more informative captions in these can't wonderful instantiation of this idea this intuition image cap thinking about the can't the caption that is distinguished entourage different kinds of corporate associated with Barracks some of it from semantic parsing it's down here that you exciting RTE weather Cork Netflix those philosophers I showed you don't ask me why it's called two and I can never remember song is a newer one from stand for and actually released the crowdsourcing engine that would allow you to collect your own reference games turn off stop you I just wanted to just read a few ideas x won't go through them in detail but the simplest case of the protection does a wonderful purpose for this cold start where is a classic case of a problem that you will not solve with looking at text alone it is not effect about statement like great idea sarcastic when used by certain people in certain cars corpus is derived from red turn the do there because you could learn user and beddings form in bed all of those things are influencing the decision about whether another it's like radio play Paramore that's easy just add more representations into your mod random effect turn it on a few other cases this is an example where you can do something similar but in the context of social underground and kind of King interior intuition earlier about knowledge graphs this is wonderful from James Allen where the contacts that you're in is a webpage structure another way to think about how you can get beyond the limitations of language by actually having a rich representation of the hope it is out there so there's no shortage of destruction can't I did mould of like smart just wanted to point out this is this is this wonderful so just give me 1-minute so agents private collaborative game it's kind of hard to see but their goal was to just be co-located with this card here they succeeded if they both say communicate anything about the incentives to actually communicate we just said you have this ability to understand language of it comes in and a producer differ chain just like moving around in the bord weather agents get train the few hours of policy exploration which is like training for the smart play things like this agent found the card but what it said was Top the other agent off for the top probability for thinking of the cars at the wait for them to be very quickly from the scan of grounding together with the rewards use misleading Lang week of policy expert produced to order at same time they realise that there's a reason for them to prove it do they can quickly influence the actions of the other agent and they solved the problem quick agents of setup for every moment for them is misery all they want to do is find this card so that they're freed from this misery pretty quickly wearing that they should produce ordering Gracie and things that we Claim was emerging from their grounding this particular go the problem with these models is that they really interactable singer just waiting for your the day when they get replaced by neural approach in terms of what they learn for policy how to deal with changing I think that kind of keys me up for these next frontier so what I expect is much deeper integration with devices in the environment desiccated reasoning about Goals tracking of dialogue history snow approximate state representations to address the scalability of here is going to lead estate agents that are truly ground agents that are truly able to use language and thanks
