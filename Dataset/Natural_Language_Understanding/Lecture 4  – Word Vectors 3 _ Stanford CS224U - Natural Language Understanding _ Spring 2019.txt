turn off the TV my plane is which is really just a bit next week send a text play Radio 4 today and we'll get through this stop a rush show Jewson Hackney restore the notebooks if you haven't already to get a more hands-on look at the material you can just drive into home you should certainly make sure that your system is set up to Jamaica today now feeling like you're ready to just work productively on the problems of the teaching team or here in the room I'll give you the details on that radio where are you could video in to talk to some of the team were going to be available on a kind of cute right now and I just want this is the moment I'm working do not wait until Monday afternoon radio Doncaster any questions or comments tomorrow online tomorrow play Always by video call in between range email redirection beyond the Trailer ok cancel calzone Colleen turn off that I had 22 secret some nice words about this paper I'm a big fan the intuition and also hear some other practical details about implementations that you might you so we're using a large imitation electric in a in a minute I'm going to show you connotation that is very very slow play what she was due to just naively influence the algorithm and I think that deserves to see exactly how does complications I'm not saying that you should use it for anything beyond study play introduce glass I gave at the top there when they present is kind of their ideal object add 4 row representation or Rowan bedding why it's product with a column in betting w sub k primary term and then you have to bias terms playback should be equal to the value of the current probability proportional to light on further study ideal reconstruction of what that dog products set alarm of the coconuts probability as the log of the Colour current account minus the law thank you too loud at the rows and columns in different so you wanna not just concentrating criminalising on metro but also on the call this expression here which isn't in the paper but I think it's the spirit of the paper because even for there later choose the rows and columns could be different reconstructed the co-occurrence problem occurrence minus the product of 4 to the rhone the column what I just put it out to you with your dad's pmr play some steps for the calculation of PMI are you concert my see that you're getting from this picture is that is built on that peer mind the same as BMI of course because we're doing it returning regularise racial representation hi it's just a reweighting of the entire account Matrix an entry bicycle of when you think of glob you could think of it first insight switch off there a few more details for the paper that I think I really important for violent work so well so I guess I just repeated the original love and objectives of Puritan version of it would you see down here the new pieces like at its core you have that product again on the role in the car lights in the car shut down the alarm early weird by this function at the function of the counts doing essentially is Kinder Daily Dose count values it's a general function defined here you said xmax the default in the spirit of the paper is to setup 100 so I count to 100 what is less than max value you said it as a proportion of that x turn exponential scale in Europe Alpha greater to the max you just sent it to war setup your office 2.75 time reasonable the fast I'm going to suggest that you think about that though is that clear so far that's kind of the Hallmark when you think of Derby should think of that Cole and Mason buyers terms and then subtracting out the wall chords really 3 the dimensionality of the representation you get to set that number and you can imagine that setting in a larger values is going to give you more capacity to learn also take more time and everything else so that's something that you play with her all these models that is going to flatten out all the hi cats the idea want to play There Is but you might reflect on that value and the way you might think about it is for my company which of the values are actually after above the threshold what's 100% of that for some reason play XS Max 2 100 is going to turn your entire matrix into a bunch of one's turn off that's unlikely that you would have a count matrix that was that dance what are you doing tier matrix when you flatten out percent about that you can also think about Alpha which is going to control how much you do forecasting are below your back an example so if the incoming Road after 4 this afternoon to find boxes 199 75 10 and 1 play the screen waiting it looks like this play 98103 you doing something very important to the States when you do this new slide that I added play recognise that is very dense turn up there for a reference but let me give you a guided tour just say I was thinking about other ways that we might and analytic level get a deeper understanding of we have the PMI inside objective what could we do what is LSA before I give you the 60s and early in wicked play motivation motivation for something you that was two words that are similar to clear about kind of positive slankets maybe likely to occur with each other because they're kinda from different I like the idea and I catch to you was that our say has the capacity to recognise that they are similar to spite never called curry other neighbours in common because they they over occur together with us play terrible and as a result table to capture that inside what are the motivations there how does glove do live quiet nature turn this light counting here even visit zero value cells like my very quick reference put the word in the context matrix in the bias terms the entire matrix all-in-one city that is a precomputed thing and you could rewrite the entire matrix in the way they should be with turn off the lights restart iterating in working on specific examples you don't visit the values that are 0 because of that one problem or you won't be able to say that this is just play the definite definition of thing about blog play do when I want it can you change where my camp matrix I've said it wicked and normally never co-occur version of example I made it word by word because it first requires M2 does have the capacity to do it gas what's your hunch play sleep what happens I think experimentally is what do is push button Arlene wicked away from terrible and turn at current values for down its ability to do that in order to achieve this abstract connection it does happen so will I do for this little problem is I just got rid of the bias term so that I could display the calculation started the glove optimisation process in the weather I was sure that Narnia wicked were really far so innovation one I basically made them should be completely Completely separate parts of the space what's going to happen as I do this up exactly your intuition what I've decided to do is look at what's happening for both of them as it relates to net for TV this is wicked and terrible and awesome and that's all I'm off to dimensional space here and after 1 iterations really has been reorganized awesome wicked and here's an early and terrible play keep running this then early in the gravity closer awesome and farther away from there dancing which will be capturing the abstract simulator on the right here but I've done what kind of colour coding is just make that really concrete so there are the counts up in the upper left reweighting how are you 0 and I can't expect that the starting point sing for me and Richard and how they're going to get closer to awesome calculation this is just the derivative of the globe of Jack if you get these error terms updates the weights another iteration the error terms that smaller that is just as you see in the picture over here play Imagine that he's going to get closer and closer phone insurance yes a snarling wicked awesome terrible and I said it up something awesome is really freaking Stellaris + Marlene wicked was terrible set a timer for 45 and a 6 with terrible because you got positive do you like it I just feel like I will end up with the one I showed you before I showed you before and after on the distribution of values this is really nice looking right to the rockhouse Communion the heaviest really difficult scaling this Glass is coming in and you get this my completely normal distribution here values and look how nicely descale between negative will see there's something return to the spine again again Michael and deep learning models that we look at our going to be very sensitive to the scaling of incoming values and you could just say that this is a really nice starting on Chronicles networks because everything is kind of scale National Castle Park as well as an input to another play gloves play Judas just loading the data from school IMDb 5 IMDb 20 and I just running the function that would work turn on zero values download apps IMDb five it's about 2% 20 x 15 corresponding to the factor IMDb 20 has much larger window denser because more things can occur with other things your dad is interacting an important way was the Chosen value because I've done relatively little IMDb 5 by 3 all lights IMDb 20 hours did you use that you may should have been 1 to 1 missing the past 9 to think about Travis Scott snippet here what I did is just this idea objective is to learn products for personal account perfectly achieve this objective get a perfect correlation between the dot product of two vectors and their occurrence in the original camping shops turn off function correlation test that does that a rainbow for a little while you that cheers about 38 IMDb 5 and about 20:44 a.m. I'm out today rainbow expect to get larger than 4 measure of turn the living up to the objective what kind of how much for compromising on the original calculator reconstructed which account so maybe sunglasses is useful describe change just one change I meant to do a shoutout for that somebody noted that I had taken the log twice it doesn't matter whether you take it in the line rope rod with roller turn down the volume the scaling and since the correlation test that I chose is sensitive to the scaling of the values the original correlation for Messiah so hyper downstairs rewrite but it's doing so well one more modern here I'm just going to do this one quickly and I can justify that in part by the fact of the tentacle tutorial representation vector representations of words is basically introduction to work and it's really really good people temple the others that if you want to train your underwear to bed representations then Jenson is a nice Python package arbitrary scale make a new studio stimulant Justice can you talk it play Metal idea that I take it forward to back is but I can take a cork labour latest do that is by setting a window size just the way we did for our count matrices time is it in that window as labelled training instances this is a positive skip that sequence can I say it say it is labelled with that all of this conference Paris any kind of supervision right it's not turn it's like a positive example of this work stop 212 invest 20K set a timer set an alarm you said it the more training day you having some sense basic model and softmax classifier you might have seen the situation before all the way down to this sound waves starting to get used to about this model is that c label vector for an individual exam volume nationality of your retired or cavalry if you have 20000 words in your vocabulary 20000 forward having a single dimension having a war what's another word for training instance with your input word obviously really what's the train and it's quite slow but that's the intuition right is that I created this label dataset and then I just do a very standard thing in machine learning which is have a classifier that learns to prepare pause happens in this very high dimensional space inside behind that's called the skip Brown variant one other thing I think about is I can do this for individual examples as they come wait for my entire vocabulary of independence when you freeze it that way you start to see this is kind of like another one of these matrix factorization that's right embedding space turn text embedding space w are those dark rocks tomorrow is pushchairs that products in a particular Direction is in the direction of favouring things that cover Kerala this favourite things practical terms I think people don't use this model because of the very high dimensional you seen someone's the problems so the more popular version which is implemented for you in tensorflow tutorial is called Escape room with noise contrastive estimation turn of approximation of that model that I just showed you where instead of doing it very high dimensional thing sum of two separate of jackets Ryanair for the left here in the things that actually help her painful so negative instances advice about had a simple negative things that you didn't see you never come this works in all because of course they like compared with the ideas that on average with a hardcore Place when I sent all these negative instances they will be unlikely to appear together right2dance is there something that you would want to sing idea something like that suggest which is very carefully about which words are possible I think they don't do that has some skins for sampling from the frequency distribution which might animal I'm going to it what's the word for trying to get down to work skip to appear next to the Superb seen anything like that stop place for innovation just because of Central Park really doesn't rees-mogg this is play trading to study distributional representations and I think I've been very successful amazing how well it works given that they operate only and tolerance is 6 in large datasets there are important aspects of meeting that are related in that colour concealer stop myself believe reclaim that's all there is to me Tinkerbell study by linguists or by cognitive development psychologist besides other things Bianca occurrence play some sausage ratio other people using language that stuff it's not but rather about our entire lives meted out that his distributional representations are going to tell the whole story turn off there really like about that is that love 2 ways that we could take with some supervision that is information that wasn't nearly for currency a picture of retro feeling it's really just one of many methods that you could adopt for doing kind of summary like that dancing Hatcher lots of linguistic relationships we can capture meaning sold prices and I don't like it listen change the things that I would really like to address different ways to do this a bunch of models proposed where can I get pension and use the PhD student here and this was really just taking distribution of factors that were burnt from a kind of other work centamin information volume information from a sentiment classifier you can take the space that's not well differentiated when it comes to the mixture negative and a positive call regions you could do that another example is actually so stuff that I didn't export email with more than 1 of 88 MySpace decent raining again with a deep Pacifier representations from that classifier day of course have shifted the space around supervision it really deep sentiments recall the positive and negative words into their own car in space please can be kind of hard to say I was really excited when I saw this retrofitting model appear this is from one of the best people set timer in work play Simple Man In The Notebook in case you wanna Explorer episode you had to work security objective play here is that this is an objective it's dancing toothbrushes I want to be like the original doctors also like to look more like my neighbours in a knowledge graph play little bit is that you trained a bunch of representations by whatever methods to have some letters for a vocabulary of English what's your retrofitting is that you could find all of those words say in the word digraph I know you can imagine that those nose in that Beretta actually your picture representation Stephanie model does this say try to remain like those original better update set a more like their neighbours in the knowledge graph play Richard retrofitting space ground and some kind of draught you can run this objective 30% 0 is related to 1 and 2 unidirectional section retrofit in you can see that 0 moves closer to Rotherham can you put 1 and 2 because they're not related that is euro which direction are going what's the weather all related to each other use retrofit start looking to pull together singers by the scrap similar to everything else because if it's connected I meant dessert alpha and beta turn off little one and beta to 1 and evenly balanced alpha 20 reducing Edge case right say I don't care what the original very much like all I care about is being like my neighbours direct me home conversely if you set off a really high you're really remain like your original representations and the graphical having time between now and you might find something that's kind of useful making using the original bed to have it out there in the world so I gave the example of words really easy online training for words in English and this pre-existing structure this lot of data can be represented in a graph play structure is anything for for the retrofit play some extensions here one thing that you might find on satisfying about the original retrofitting model is very deeply the idea that connected in the grass it means like my neighbours 1 semantics released pretence there is an edge relation for internet to say that just because I'm left at that age but I want to be similar to that were very different semantics from for example synonym turn off Wi-Fi extension to be released for the special relationship look at box for the full story because there are some data processing example using for example firing I did it end on graphical representation any Sullivan beddings and then decided you look good cheesecake closest neighbours and then artificial informer graph that way and then from there covid-19 the original space connect things that don't know what would happen I guess what you been saying is really want to be together and everything else you can have him for the background I have some other resource some other craft together I don't know you could try it out and see what happens it's like today YouTube converter the question original test the task wordnet and framenet TV experiment something or something hey Google Liverpool please play trailer for The Beach what song was basically weather in combined forces that is bring a bunch of different pieces together and see some games I think the general answer is yes I think about is what's the overall scaling of the representation that you're creating harmonized or is it obviously has two things together WhatsApp how you see some recent papers that use contextual number of places that actually as well have you any more dimensions and even more information to the farm and DC turn off turn down to squash together off of the scampi two-seater thing that you cancel
