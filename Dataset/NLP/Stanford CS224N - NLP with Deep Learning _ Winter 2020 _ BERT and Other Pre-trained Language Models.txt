play the talk about Bert and also some because the work and then some happened in the last year last minute polyp l recent advancements and that happened has been back turn lamps wedding beddings in a right that kind of the basis for why neural network artwork in a continuous space vectors in matrices and text is a discrete space enter the newbies something to bridge the gap turns out the thing to put for gap broadcast a lookup table from vocabulary to a vector that swear and discriminatory and end at like benjo 2003 northern soul paper the train just going to B&M actually into them people trained language models and then use these pretrained anyway as pre-trained representation product who's the best just used in bed and then where do they have in stock in along where then people found a much cheaper my scalable where the training where you can Dr satistics of the lingham expensive food for later to go through it anyway kingscott like billions of Turkey rtb right is that these word example the word bank if you say open a bank account in our riverbank it's gonna be the same stuff like sense embeddings return to single word that is a for word sense example of the most almost any word has a different meaning depending on the car even like open the bank account and I went to the bank they still in a different senses of the word think one of them is different using different tenses and so context representation Radio 1 something where is a representation of a word after its been the context of the temperature going to be like at the bottom applications for first big paper which type of connector applications was a paper from Google and 2015 Colt my sequences and Andrew dying quickly and so in this one actually very similar to the paper is taken after it didn't get much attention they had some classification task existing ltm model using creature in the bedroom AXA promises 2003 they said let's actually pretty entire model as a language fine-tune it for a classification pretty good results but not like Stella result play Let the reason why the training updating the same size model that parrot opening to big but that's kind of this is already time Stretton it would have been number 20 at an inn 14 which way Washington nei to enter this one where they took start on a big website and I'm doing work big man ls4000 hidden dimensions which is quite expensive and they trained by directional model so but it was kind of weekly bi-directional where they trained elaborate model and the two compact drawer unit play Elmo is there actually change your existing model take whatever task specific malolactic you have might be some sort of antimatter why you do else came over the Sorting over or over the question and answer then you can you turn to one another and in whatever kind of actress you out in this where we were change before now you put so disgusting of your on you know everything at the time question answering farting because existing can't stay without metal but the money's worth anything and so then after that can I post anything with the free training which is that be called GPT 1 yes they simulator cockpit train a very large like 12 or 12 of which at the time was turn on the weather is actually like today for open when I actually thought that it was not that it was worse but there can be showing off which one have you got more than 3 but now you know the Doctor Who this that they had was actually Canada Crusoe sing a fairly simple as well a very bad one and that is fine by taking the last token and then navigation weather in Agadir they're supposed to be on lots of different classifications but I'm going to be next to take a outside here if I go to birth which is about transformer that was the other kind of big things like the big pre-christian that allowed and gp to work go to transform to find about and so all the details about MP for Leigh I'm good thank you but the big thing about why this kind of took over is 1 is that there's no locality by long-distance contact had a equal opportunity the short distance contact which is self-reliance not understanding that the bias of is a generally considered to be a good day is more reminder BT advert another man's work is it they actually can catnip pan what does this entail sentence to Dunnes Stores me like before puberty was that you would like in Cowdenbeath auto Woodhouse gym then you would have attention from one to the other you can just put them into the same sequence I given separate sequence better and it will learn how to think the 1:50 as locally they can also attend all the way to be honest promised no it just easy for over 20s turn the heating to pack in your signal sequence and then everything will be learnt rather than having to do architecture which is entertaining a pretty important thing about his models thing is hey formers lstm this is a batch and is the word in the battery of two sentences in 4 words considered one of the time so you only got about 2 of 2 effective on Modern hardware pictures keep using GPUs the bigger the major transportation the better that you want all three dimensions too big stick it in my ear exercise to measure muscle be small not too bad but then that's too expensive for lunch it's the clearwise tents the best title number for 500 word sentences xc32 2512 is the Taliban and you can take advantage of modern hardware the kind of why the transformer has taken over because of these two things that's why I was using gpg in my achievement talk about bird with the previous GPT and is that the only used that context for right context definition of really earnings bi-directional this clear why is my level in train on unidirectional models you can only see the letter only to the right in order to understand language to work in both directions so one is that language might have the story had the news for switches in other system so I could be a predictive text right which is directly just click next work the other applications addaction what common are using in machine Translation system or speech recognition system where you have features like or acoustic singer tomorrow what's the probability of how to be a while phone District actually don't care about this but this was kind of something that kind of people have just been like kind of I'm afraid you'll have to have a distribution probability that can a bigger reason is that words can see themselves in a bi-directional encoder representation incrementally have your input and output is always after by 1 weekend we had the Startup settings stuck in reflect the first word then we feed in the second word within the first round pick a second work and so we can go to settings what's the weather in the second with unidirectional model until it's good sample efficiency right 512 dimension 2 500 words we don't want one word for the 2500 X compute to get the same amount of pressure Direction lcmr transformer play some work your settings every everything is bi-directional until after the first layer open Perfect down to open and switch tribute to break a word that can that can work in The Impossible there's no there's no actual prediction Lyon switch the horcrux apart is that lets instead of language model netscout you went to the mask to buy a mask of coronavirus from Milan and because they were done in the airport you can't the downside of this is that United Kingdom any protection 15% of 1 you very much my rich mother because you're saying ok is a hyperparameter that we have to so we use 15% it turns out that actually coming up with people so we can ask people since they have done more terribly this 15% is good for the reason and the reason for doing a 20% over another if you were to do a 50% we would also mask out can you connect your model and if you want to do one word that that might be optimal maybe but you have to do when my data processing should be Weymouth into the train my nose mi basically just computer let me just have enough data you can just connect you better trade-off between these two things someone at the Widow be telling his supaporn the Masters never seen the fine tuning time how is word with the mask pumpkin would randomly sometimes pretty good with a random word and sentence keep the same way it's so simple sometime I take into the store and went to the running and it wouldn't tell the model switch we would we were just have it it would have to say this word be writing didn't know whether it's really so it could be the same Whittaker 10% x 2 cm work that could be random word and side has to basically be able to maintain a good representation of every word because it doesn't know whether it's really that's actually looking at this is right work so we can potentially go away with not using that again no just doing this time and the time but the reason for doing that is that you know then we'll be cracking a lot of later early because of this is the wrong word we might mess up our prediction for some other way over here right so no that's not right I don't use that as part of contact the kind of details banana pudding I want to be that we doing we're not this morning words relationship between second so question and particular we have a query which is generally a sentence and then we have a answer which the pair good afternoon my want to answer the by doing that we temperature a sentence for predict and so we don't want to be negative attack play that we did this is we are just where we just from the same quarter Tanya from the sun the next step and so if you sound like the man went to the store he began a milk that is an extension to the name of the store payment of playlist that something now for cinema low at 310 time to actually make to look at the full settings next some sort of temperature and help with quieter to something question answering the question and answer import representation turn light to normal transformer additional embeddings which are called cinnamon transformer you would have and then you would do word for segmentation right when you split up and revise turning up words into optical splitter using logical wrapping mycological right now the burial is always spreading the character vocabulary talking buildings another position in the bottom part of the transformer transforming the calcium don't have any sort of the weather in Cork that is that you actual embedding for every position has got absolutely technique now and then which is there's a 70 of this kind of generalizing more imagine if you're saying you're trying to say like I'm searching might say here's my query here's the title here's the URL here's to Doc in account Pakistani singing secrets and give them different settings for typing now you get a variable to have a much stronger just ripping everything at this kind of same singers different distancing in betting active learn this is in contrast to the older style where you were different for every part so you have a different kind of the query and the tailor made for your help with this gift turn on about a few billion word at the time large now it's not actually turning on about time Al salam 40 pack of 82 mi still relatively where is a 12A attempt to create an annual 24-hour internet work basically like which marathons have been trained other people training model that I think bigger than get in the morning in terms of the last procedure is so we doing this my love for these two tasks and so now we have an input sequence with multiple sentences with different piping bag through the transfer we have a special on bedding which so this is this is this connect the next expedition used Auto for classification amusing in betting right we are retirement alright it's really not that it's that wait inside the entire 12/24 layer model and so by fine-tuning the entire model you can kind of pick up the ceiling parts that are important for some dancing task Enzo this is the kind of the class specific functioning if we ever single classification task like analysis the positive and negative review a sentence with the play try to me before we have 3 likes play neutral it's maybe 1000 x 3 is 3000 KM and 300 million 3000 new parameters in 300 million all parameters and the train all ring class 3000 but because we can adapt to it and only like a few thousand for a class we do sent to the different Endings so we have if you want to say does this entails as you say put it and then also predicts run from the Stoke and fine-tune your texts so similar very few different parameters play finishing time start Emma Spencer online 2000 a premises for tagging plastic part speech s******* you just play you are everything I told I maybe every talking to that the workpieces like can a practicing you project what's the Polish Peter why are but itself is really a kind of incremental improvement over with ID Transformers GPT 3 ideas a pretty simple on top of them but the reason why it's not just the numbers that are showing through slight it's really this there was really no fundamental difference between a context on that about to head to head because a lot of people earning historically has been morning in miles read to you have all these components to connect LEGO blocks that you have four layers where motivation lstm and you can just that's ok for this new tab all these together in a way that's best right and so Elmo it wasn't really I think I'm mentally it was just you just heading to adjust email and get Siri GPT 1 it was in things didn't really work out because it was a left-to-right language and you could just take the last token and then predict classification test but didn't make any sense to put speech tags because for the first word is no can't I sent a picture with no context with you had such high impact play the kind of people by texting so there's nothing is necessarily a good thing because as a researcher as a researcher kind of how to make all the researchers often agree to stop another job rightly it's like if I physicist and nothing anyone in this area the greatest moment also that was kind of a lot of research solve the problem I took so Burt uzes now like all the data for customer problems this really would like a lot of the need to do that's fine and so the impact that it's kind of like the objective in packing that's why I've had so much and is because it has kind of had this effect on now used to be like designing fine Uno models it's just is one of these 4 recipes for Aldi's to retest so in terms of actual empirical result to do so at the time the hit with a request things have done since then so this new task is a set of cancel monitor all settings parasense got to get I would be hills and mountains are specially think about in jainism and then pops is jainism his nature that contradiction order for an optimal to be able to understand correctly and need to know that pronounce our st25 the good thing and I think something is a bad thing and be able to all of this reasoning right reasoning call Ali ability I can do the wagon ramble down the road vs the car park down the road and so are you one of them to 20 speaker sounds weird and generalize on switch at the same time is opening it significantly beat opening what is the prettiest area of course get the results which is only surprising that it got better results across the board including on the very very tired it's only a few thousand turn the more than just the fact that it got better results because historical when there is a rose of them about if you have examples how do you design the marathon and so if you don't you're preaching take me to mall bigger without Bridge Bruce results because you might go over your trainer one path of the day anyways so there's almost no limit to how big you can in with the tiny amount of fine-tuning data in a true that one of the in the takeaway screenshot likely what did us take the second oldest shark so in this case there is no answer I told you to build that there's no answer and phase there's no answer show Birkby increase the timer by about 6 points which is a pretty big game now it's gone past the mobile yeah it was large so this one there is this for things that I'm comparing off Broadway size models that the bird basement time is next so in our case even though people are not that important in our case we couldn't measure it turns out it seemed like it was in 4 Samsung cast which is this one Al Noor forum it's kinda doesn't running some model that learns between is the one that makes an Apple's to apples comparison between open sdp-1 and right because I also I made the bigger but not probation bases exercise that was kind of my day Sheraton I basically retrained my interpretation of opening eyes gp1 hi yellow line this is actually pretty big gap put on some weight what to make sense because the Stanley bank tell me how invert the meaning of basically no can't asking you to do spend labelling on Words With with emotional contour new much worst to make a fairy llcm on top of it with the train from Shrek but another ones it doesn't help so I can't wait house because now you have bi-directional the very small cast Billy a3000 at the show that they're kind of the mass time is Milo and internet subscription are both important especially that the nestling as well play other blessings is when we apply that the mass language model only percent of words in the right language and every single word commission all the words to left baby how much does this make it take longer to confirm you know eventually another candidate much better point the training budget is it better to do after right now are we see that the bi-directional DC the very beginning because you doing something more predict does do better at the Attic stop one but then very soon after because the back now be so important it's her to take over and so it's basically better from start to Dubai directionality and then my tyre LE4 4AE see that a smile over 200 million to 30 mg of the lot which isn't surprising with the most surprising thing is that one of these curves is that these are comparable look at the car premises see that this one is 2000 labourer pebbles simulator which is surprising because what's gone over your data if you only have a few a few labels turned out naturally between more and is Turkey got any updates and now it's going to be able to talk about what's the best with this big one is 300 million x 011 building premises and still seeing similar behaviour still Scenic setup Intent close simple but you know it was very successful Google Brandon like no doubt looking at other open source releases and signal what people don't like about like when you're when you're busy and even working industry as a and trying to do something so I can have just listed the things that were important for like why was the things just to be mean but like the one release was really good and very good and so you're not like I like is going on in America with no comments there is no interaction so like also are you if I could wish for entire you know language team and so they put that people so I was very insistent that we do Emma no really so like this ridiculous perk it's not leave anything as yet very welcome and also easy the drop-in are interested or convection or just the transaction Close out because network then so I think because of that people can start using it much quicker I think that you know it could have easily you know improve on top of various ways more than 5 but I'm going to highlight this I think they're interesting Google but not because I'm bored Google hey Google from Bury to the prisoners who were supervised by another computer I mean the reason from Google is because Microsoft Mini I have the resources to training Tuesday at marathon sell Saturday 2020 come from one of these the first one was Roberta one of the Head Like A least I can do new stuff it was really until the 21st of May what they showed was that but was under train play tick tock single man 24th if you do it for like 200 packs you get even better results in significant me so the more we booked on the same day improve masking in preaching using a couple of a couple of tweaks to that 
 74 xlnet play music with Google Play play something really cool when was the transformer XL which was actually the same people that streamlink Telecaster pre-training the big one of the inhibition of transformer Excel is the city of relative position precision bearings is that every get like this is word for this is worthwhile is one-sixth until the armbands I generalize but in practice there's a quadratic relationship how does work a three-letter word 76 write that want you get big relief 500000 1000 sq297 obviously not once you get her large size Enzo basically can dog attends too high should the word dog attend to the previous word and then you get non-linear at 4 and then you say Harwich this context reverso sheepdogs how much would the previous work and then you cannot get this is much better and any other one which is specific to preaching and not just the motel Insignia premonition hard to explain very formally I guess and so but basically check where in electric language tomorrow I'm predicting the worker left right but imagine instead of instead of picking out if you can make it take any presentations I'm going to predict the first word third word in the second word in the fourth at the Toby Ballard way you still get their welfare and probably should be going to WV10 the time given some fermentation the employer attention you connected to this very efficiently just messing about your technical ability everything I've text you have you can sample a single permutation turn you can effect between bi-directional model because this word everybody only English and have the words but this word will be mission on you know what happened to Rightmove it'll be missing these words but that's fine and so a really clever idea cancel the individual x on it and so Betta temperature c because they're able to turn around weather in bed because the way that nasty is done in Transformers attention play also similar everything's 100 baby people think there's certain change the so apple to Apple these two techniques in Action it had more innovation in terms of so Albert it's cold 4 surprising and so play the couple of Cortana Britons into the hair is really sharing with the idea being that if you share prime and can get better Lingard model but you bring it better sample efficiency overfilling when you fine-tune because you have can you find in the monetary 100000 labelled examples but if you if you have a match my number if your premises unit letter recording the innovation to wear so instead of using a wooden tables big the size of your have your calculator work pieces x hidden side how much play the useeffect right in April 2000 news like 100 putting bedding in a project that without using 1024 100000 100000 + 1024 x 28 and X together effectively you have a1024 100000 you have much for a pram under time reduction in April when is Crossrail premier Jenkins similar as a simple and it was special timer switch on the light you can have a much bigger tomorrow Edinburgh Hilton to get leftover fitting excellent my brother important thing to keep in mind is that Albert is light in terms of parameters not introduced for the next for the Manor Vets whereabouts slightly in this matter were about the same but the transaction slower so it's only when they started is that much bigger in terms of computer rambutan good results until play this is that but still how to reduce the amount of printing computer prescribe which is in Canada when is 250 cancelling Wi-Fi texting for me so this was buy a Google brain Google where they use just computer and tons of ablation on ring like I wasn't coming with some supercover new printing technique every app how much is 3 mm how much is 22 dirham how much is exactly what you do the Preacher and doing nothing like how many stand do you mask very clearly play Push the limit of size and see what happens if we have 300 million and then it's a different operation Everything is Everything lower a little bit bleak presents that making the date of it wasn't like you know perfectly use that doesn't matter I like you can do 20% 25% you can do this fighting recipe this one seriously it's all that really matters is making a lot of pain in my data little bit of a of a big paper if you there is exist some free train which is super competition efficient and also can get you now very impressive results which is in but like most of his evidence newspaper that is maybe the most positive interaction is this paper called Electro cancel settle down by a tram and so radio so basically the idea is generate the output you just as it is you have a local language tomorrow yeah you do some asking you a local image I love your place is it whether to Reading morning here is that you are you get better sample efficiency for preaching because your predicting every exactly why would be there from from from from from still only place without with the matter where you are so the bigger the biggest difference is that is that desire kind of context completely forgot to tell that this was not at work unicellular which word should be replaced but this actually Tuesday weak but still non-trivial Englishman up to predict which works like this locally mix Centre Sheffield to me up but doesn't make any sense just trying my luck when I put it straight that's a week strongman 022 car but this result are positive with regard to a computer person like for if we could pick about this real so which is large tube light the state of the art models you know the singer Nana good as Deborah large work about the Auditorium and get some bits for you to do as much computer as to the actual 4.4 x 5 is there ever do better but this is a pretty big gap at 4 no it's it's positive but it's not like the silver boot in terms of and you know prefer for cheaper that is because you know I've said it sound of a train plastic ring news all over the place right so like you know there is new storage Google is improve 10% understanding and princesses in Britain April so answer this is live in Google searching searching so they're like a brilliant services right the head like a few minutes buildings of today going to die on Home and so you are just a service if we actually be certain but we're serving using this around for a while Nestlé caramel compression one of the first papers was the smell commercial paper there was done for then didn't stay for the ceiling age and you're not even more on the internet paper on this the Google in the original it must be using this email this lesson for it's very simple what what what between Australia and we can most afford to train right because of course you can take it bigger but we reception budget up you know we want to find it for a day and some number to be used we find unit b a l l the maximum accuracy in literature modernism lightning and label in which is typically foremost in the industry application you have on labelling because you have you know search you have for the train and so even then it take these and you via examples with them service you so don't you bring me Ronnie platypus teacher get a single label in this training match tomorrow 2 x 120 produced you can generally do this tasks you can do doing a huge 5200 crashing with no debris don't realise that we're not compressing the preaching Mallet sell we haven't really had any work doing that so I can't actually just take an incompressible smaller my love we've been fighting for all other taxes only after you've chosen that asking after you find him variable so spell some so what time we have to do it as an Amazon book reviews list of the people that as my group has 50000 labelled examples and 8 million use fighting on in Brick large you you could be able to get it right Aberdeen outlet instead of using due to much smaller version to this one what's 1 104 size what's the weather to 100% if you would appreciate this on the same opium play kazoo which is no 60% go to 80% teacher label you million examples for calluses classification map review on his examples you can take this 102 110 tomorrow and get the same attitude what destination is that you can get Mallow tomorrow but you still need to train the big man on the 1st so doesn't have the training course I just wanted to use this thing to label millions or billions exam prince of military service bedtime why does distillation work play this is that it's going to be ultimate in a peach where's my love is also a perfect system turn my analysis call

that is fundamentally harder than language understanding which is not hard to buy in the state-of-the-art models for language understanding or fundamentally simple and what I do like supplement

Tyne and moreover details about improvements for making the training work they have a benefit in terms of least getting surgeries alarm email at matchams really just about a couple stop it from a research project particularly good for me from people who want to build in up a system than who want to officially domain-specific canopy systems like people who want a job to medical domain of people were on the automatic data for people who wanted to start up an actual product and I think sometimes you research unfortunate from that perspective but you know I still think there's there's a
