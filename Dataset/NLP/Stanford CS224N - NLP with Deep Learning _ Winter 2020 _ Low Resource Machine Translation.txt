I'm really delighted and to introduce a third guest speaker is Michael Le around so he's originally from and then worked at nyu with yarn with two and then has posted off with Jeffrey kids and so he's a very dyed-in-the-wool deep learning research work with an areas by teacher learning and the last few years he's really turned his interest natural language processing and in particular in the last few years he's worked a huge amount in Buckingham translation general and particular machine translation of languages for which less resources are available so I thought about 6 months ago on this topic and through him and his team at Facebook bed really got a lot of exciting you work in ways to bring your machine translation up to the next level and side hope that this I'm really great opportunity to see some of the latest and most exciting techniques and machine translation next level beyond we talk to you guys ok thank you so much for inviting me let me just put my face I'm here I everybody I'm going to be so you can focus on the presentation Cher hope you should be able to see my presentation now I'm very excited to tell you a little bit the ball law resource machine translation start by the machine translation problems we want to translate between English and French restart collection of sentences in English with responding translation French call a parallel dataset the sentences in English we call them a sore sentences what we call the target sentence the learning problem is about for a given sentence in English you want to predict the respond the weather we do that is by minimizing the cross entropy loss is the natural ability of the reference human transformation given the input source Centre is by the best thing in The Descent is there a sequence to sequence with attention that espaliers in ou study done and you have the number on a few weeks ago after you train this at this time novel English sentence I want to produce the corresponding we usually employ a new list red snapper like beer fine the tallest sentence that maximizes the operator given the the given source sentence at the high-level how much in Translation work let's think about the assumptions that we have been making to this discussion so the first something's that we're working with to February later languages like English and French that's something that we have at our disposal a large dataset of because here we are essentially doing supervised learning and it is a beautiful example of end-to-end supervised learning that relies on the availability of a large there are more than 6000 languages needless to say this language is don't belong to the European family or which mass of the recent research on machine translation has been focusing on you made you look at English English is spoken by less than 5% of the languages spoken by less than 5% of the world population where to count how many people speak assistant language and you look at that histogram it's a very heavy this take the tour spoken languages can you set times for less than 50% of the people in the world ok Barry of the deal dozen languages for which there are very few speakers and the assumption that is not digitised data material for you to drink anything so all those I think it's list the meaning of despair London languages for which there is digital data we don't have good ways to translate now it is you think about providers like Google a yandex baidu Facebook and stuff play translation for the top 100 live feeling very mad at the far end of this long distribute level two machine translation in the middle I think we could do with it would be very bad what happens if we walk down these days so is there data degrees decorates very much with the quality of the automatic machine translation systems as you can see here find a dusty drop-in Acura show pizza that we had in mind the difference resource language like Nepali which is the language spoken in Nepal north east of India with more than 25 million people so not as helpful people first of all German three later is now as much as English France is much much less than that let's use a different visual representation rectangles with a colour that corresponds to the language who is English teacher in the who is alligator is the barrel is not just such a monitor thing some part originates in English and some parts originates in Polish let's represent Nepali translations of English data a rectangle response to the language and where are you feel it or not depends whether this is translation is so whether this is a human translation or whether it is data originating in the library translate into Nepali and so this is the right rectangular under saying for when you go from the party 42 nights in English and originates Nepali come from different from different domains so here on the y-axis you have the domain and so in this example that what happens in baptism this is my account wrong the sea Bible Nepali translation from the Bible DD sentences from parliamentary I really mean that translate you know what sentence from the Bible is not a super interesting task because the pipe was a pretty static maybe we want to translate newspaper but we don't have any parallel data in the news to me and we have so what were we want to do a DNS translate sentences from this that is English news internet in the news the main is at most monolingual data was in English and Nepali so the English sentences that are not aligned sentences over new sources ok pretty come together learning setting because play top parallel sentences from the Darkside or you have in the domain of Interest is better in fact also some other in another language Lexi Hindi family is Nepali maybe he's in a different books and perhaps you have some wondering will Data in Hindi that is also in their book that is what you find is that you may have a lot of languages here from wish you could learn a lot of the means or you want to do at the end used to be able to translate English Nepali supervision for that you don't have any label date and paralytic is a bounce dating different men sand in different languages and so the question is Emirates old is data perform your original translation task Mondrian like learning setting is pretty tricky this is going to be the topic of the inspection what laws does machine translation speaking a language barrier can be considered a low resource when the number of the sentences in domain is less than Â£10 order of magnitude and this is very little play if you think that mother euro machine translation systems hundreds of mirzapur challenges that are challenges that contain the data and selling sister Birthday to the model design turn it down play hard to it is very hard to figure it out play data to train data rupees.in to the domain that you're interesting translating if data doesn't exist love languages on other domains how to get data to evaluate your system Morningside there is the question of of course how to learn with no supervision supervision to operating this for which you have so many languages and some other means is Christmas from the beginning is Natalie and my always been Trust supervision does machine translation is at least personally a very unique opportunity turn 18 which Miley says agenda is a line with an application station you don't have much sleep or data and you need to make who is on with auxiliary data in order to perform well and this is a general problem combine machine translation is something that improves we can really Abbott's Hunstanton a lot of applications and and the light of a lot this concludes my introduction about translation and the issues that we face when working on this languages or just pause for a second in the line of the stock cost around $3 in a way define cyborg research what is data review how we can get data in particular for evaluation so it is the prerequisite to do anything in our life as a martial art practitioners afterwards I'm going to the modelling so describing Sam Adams to learn underdose languages and finally I will complete with some work on analysing what are the mother dies when we three motorsource language is like a drug I keep going around the circle because I pick it out shoes that we have with a better with them other than I make a man with a data sad that better fits the kind of problems with them interested in and then I may go back to the modern side to improve their mothers and sons I'm giving some references of the words that I'm presenting not all of them insist to be cleared to be a chronological survey so this is Sally words that introduced a certain idea the most accessible entry points on the topic and then you can go on the river that works actions to pick it up was some 70 paper what's the weather Peter presenter Mercedes worth be my photos do you have any questions so far question about space talk about unsupervised big Block and woodwork of possible in robust yeah so actually I'm not even going in the details of the architecture I got it applicable to neuro machine Translation system as well as statistical systems when I go over this part I can to put your question and tell you a little bit between the two and then in terms of does the learn Word embeddings and sentence embeddings that's very briefly on that start the lecture on some recent work on filtering where people use sentence embedding methods it's something in the way for word embeddings machine translation because if you can align word embeddings to learn a dictionary primitive way to do mushrooms installation so often times we look at those things as or as a simplified machine translation task and an accuracy of your alignment let me get back to you when we talk about this daytime let's go back to our English Nepal call Abbas play Nice which horse very nice collection of the old public available in lots of languages when you go to this website the office website you find that for English Nepali there are 1 million parallel sentences so maybe I like to you than you that this is a lot of source language but what discourse are you realise that the meaning of this sentences come from jw202 which is religious magazine and then you have 6000 sentences from the Bible Eddie going to Saudi computer-related bless you interesting in translating noble sentences from the Bible this is now use policy so one thing to note is that all this data origin is from English you have nothing that originated from Nepali if you're interesting that's a translating Wikipedia is in English and Ali and Nepali is not even can someone in another domain which is just a dump of the internet but again English Nepali using publicly available data is going to be a challenge because any in domain parallel data will you have is at most some in domain even bigger problem which is that no testator so here we don't cancellations in a poly to measure the quality of our machine translation because if you don't tell quality add to compare models and it's very hard to do model selection to compare I got them painting scraper benchmark that's cool Flores distance for Facebook no resource no resource operation transformation translation your sentences in English and translated them into Nepali and sinhala DDR sentences from Nepali Wikipedia and translate them into English as well as John Cena Wikipedia this is a little bit boring because what's hard about it Antalya innotex to weather Morzine is the operation process was I'm more interesting than we thought it's hard because you professional translators in this languages and this is not even supagro results right since so without translator agency and there are not enough people which you can do baby test in Tooting one person with with another number 2 in general it's very hard to assess automatic translation data to train machine Translation system right we need to rely on other matters then does acetylcholine whiteline we would have we will send the sentences to the translators once their translations are back do cirrhosis like fluency tasks using language model forecast direction to make sure that a sentence is not translated by Simply translating the language is the decide one a lot of sex like that and then brushes that you need to start somehow photosynthesis that would be it would send them back to is there a few iterations of this than eventually the human evaluation the sentences in America human assessment tax there is not very good leader of that as you had to coli data and in particular resource language is there are a lot of issues frustration and so that with dog with big as a couple of months but I started to Cos more than 6-months immense play the best and also he didn't because we use this letter for a dog anti competition and a quarter dinar to have a test was not available to people to make sure that people will not what's the weather like on the best set you're some examples of sentences so this is from sentence from the sinner Wikipedia news from English Wikipedia sonata I don't know how many people in the audience come from Sri Lanka appreciate the support things that you can already sees that issue this is totally under total because it's just a couple of sentences from personal and big candle topper distributions difference and and here we have things that unlikely in English Wikipedia same use for an English and English Nepali we have a Giffgaff repository well before the date and also baseline models that we train on public available on this last week released another couple languages English Pashto English tomorrow are adding more and more languages this sections despacito is Upton time more important than designing model stating particle without a good evaluation benchmark is possible to do resurfacing in this area connecting that is not Freeview it's not review the process the user is not well established any block thing to consider sorry is to look at the data turn it down where you collect it and also before you starting your mother because is Sam translations if you speak the language English is on my side you may discover by Cesar you may discover interesting so always look at the data I supposed to matter in a black box what's my a little discussion are there any questions on this so in this case what we did actually with talk common crawl data remember exotic I think we had to concatenate the Wikipedia data and the phone call later because the Wikipedia data was just too small play Train account-based syndrome the Campus Anglian gives you I don't know if you started this but he keeps to the pro video won't work even sound fix window of context for a given sentence before like let's see what is it for everyone sentences simply the average or across all the words in the sentence and I will give you a score and then play have a rash all on that and so all the sentences that I'm not pointing up will be sent for reward pause an entity whenever you have put on languages that are even lower resource less than you have you don't even have relay in domain like we could be is not in all the languages and then it becomes even harder open times so now that we're looking at language smallest smallest train in the montelimar way and that are fine tune on a small this type is not bleeding so thank you for this amazing result but I just want to come in because like I've noticed I like Wikipedia actually you'll have different content with different language you choose so for example like description of some basically topic and then in other languages even if Wi-Fi really commonly usually without Chinese teenagers have completely different Condon or basically simplify contour ring light also going to happen where's like really used languages yeah I just I just generally thing that like Wikipedia my nappy like Abbey Lake very Direct reference to the translation yeah so it's it's an excellent point and this is something that I'm going to discuss morning The Terror part of the lecture this is a translation department we need to accept the fact that language a different type of distribution and content that originates in another land what do you want to say it is really content that originates in the so slime to live with it that's what it is time scene benchmark sign in define that comparable so everything that originates in English Holly is actually can't strong this being kind of sources so it's news and it's on you nothing spa in practice this is not show is not you for Wikipedia as you correctly true for you because if I look a local news in Nepal and look on yours over here is it general partner Andy says implications the map is that we're going for you I was here are to speak without saying please please let me know if anything is not let's talk about modelling and this is going to be what's the weather time number that we have this it's hard when we have domain and languages and it's a pretty complicated for simplicity we focused on English and Nepali languages and we start with a simple setting with supervised learning all data is in the single me perhaps you have a small tree inside Odessa is in the single men as the princess as the parrot Essex the sentences why the sentence be is the parallel all these sentences this is the typical empirical risk minimization prime or whereby you in this case you minimise the present you want to maximize the sentence a way to realise this is to say that is my English sentence encoder-decoder and indices we have a lot of the discrepancy between the human reference that you know you took the text you as you are translated to give you the last measure the discrepancy between human referencing no what is that here and uniting with boxes no more components in this case the blue box is the encoder that processes in send boxes the operate in Nepali I just wanted to add one more thing which is that if you don't have a lot of but you need to recognise and so you can do which is biggest tender so you can minimise the I think in the machine darling plus you might have seen like where you said to see around them hidden units in your input recorder or you can do nothing by you your present will be lost instead of us should be more over here instead of setting to work so this is the provision for the customers which you can put the rice over each individual War set a room stop whatever you you have the correct what do you want you want to predict the next one lower signing 100% of brother BT on the next world you let's see you 90% and 10% you evenly distributed across all them anymore so that the mother is not over cancel these two things are you very good ways to regularize the sis does missing person let's see what happens when we have was some sore side and so here now we have dataset that is only sentences the source language English on the source cancel exit sub um is much greater than right where to use to model the distribution of the data there are many ways to do that play the hasbro went to be pretty effective in machine translation is to do with the Noisy autumn Cody where did he is the something similar to what we had before is taken from this morning you add noise to it and I'm going to describe the night in Osaka encoder-decoder is simply to denoise The Noisy input the last measure of discrepancy between Addiction and the OXO cleaning what is the there this radical that because that now is a decoder that operates in that's not the encoder is is that the same that you are seeing here the loss function here is very similar to B4 receptor started is the cleaning good x what is x x is we are not releasing something something in if you want the limitation of this work is useful because you are anyway doing some good modelling of the input parameters that are going to be with your supervisor system so the temperature between play some Dustin predatory encoding task so it's actually have an encoder and decoder as one the operation appointment operation why is there are two types of noise that we have been using our work others are the simplest case you can drop what's or swap what's so assume that the sentences the cat sat on the mat swap wassame provider team day on Saturn you need to understand a little bit of this syntax the grammatical rules in order to reorder stop let's see you drop the last for the cassette on there then the modernist understand little bit of the semantics because he needs to assign Ryan a little bit of soul one there are several ways to use the Nigel temple so you can use me know something going away to pretend encoder as auxiliary loss when you do supervised learning so you can have loss Mr both ways are fine very critical hyperparameters which is the level of noise if you don't have any noise or it the noise level is too low is tpo because of the attention you can simply copy the input anything hi you destroyed him but here sodium cover is not useful you just do language modelling using the recorder but remember that this be colder not used used for translation because what to use in the machine Translation system is the encoder box so where's the US source side wondering world data you could also do SAD training which is another that comes from the 90s if not earlier so again you take a sentence from your side morning with a side and then you have an encoder decoder Translate noisy input reference the reference is given by a stale version of you transistor difference is produced by lightsaber I'm going to Michael the discrepancy between your prediction and war is there a version of your system gay this works is that where you do been typically better quality when you're trained now this encoder-decoder by cross entropy loss you're going to learn ok and so this is something good for you when you train you inject noise and the noises of a rising standards moving out and so if you're listening correctly one sentence now also nearby sentences about your buyer mean sentences that are similar phrases or to have a good overlap predictive this paper we analyse this aspects and sodium is very simple where is your train your machine Translation system on the parallel the following process so first you did call your mum your car in Washington state new dataset of sorry with the translation from your currency send a model display none of you are weather + this oxygen two hyperparameters one is the noise level and the other is the hyperparameters let's how we can use aside morning later a word about how we can use that assignment you was the biggest earning more data to train a language model and then turn the machine Translation system in the residual space of this language the reason much more effective way to Leverage this data Translate the high-level it works as follows so you take a sentence from morning with my tea you train also bank or machine Translation system that goes from Nepali to English ok so that you have Holly and the Boutique you might be sent this in into English 10% this may not be a correct translation import that you feed to you are you want to train no what is noisy but the target is clean because it has found the original Derby Simon very powerful because Alexa training here but what is a little noisy and that's usually much better than having cleaning quotes but noisy targets right because the target all the arrow signals that your propagate through the nft systems you can see the way to do that of mentation because you produce very film of inputs for a given a little bit like ambition what they do this another Italian stew to do this analysis by ambition you do scaling rotation different cropping and that's it to be seen as to where we're going the I land use your back tomorrow to decor outside morning with a reducing auxiliary concatenate who did the original combine turn bedroom station so if you have both how many would a DS gardening with a desert do the following so you can use the parallel data to train the forward and backward motion Sensation system and then use the former model to decode they're so sad morning with it into this data use assistant the tiger Simon with that into this translator Yew Tree this sentences real data and you can cut them to the pound train body forward and the back of machine translation systems as long as this to improve that you can patient will buy you a gang you really cold it's a morning and then you go and you returned and this is a Spanish no the way to Leverage minalima data what language is this bit about how we can do multilingual training so in this case we have datasets on different language parts so you have a brother to support English Nepali 14 in Hindi Hindi English or Hindi or any subset of these easiest super simple so the way that it works is that you have a single and colder and the single Dakota you drained by supervised learning any change that needs to be main is the at the input of the encoder you comfort and also it talking that specifies the language in which you want to translate the encoder buses multiple languages will earn to Die 2 use multiple languages as well we picked the language based on the docker specify but Indian quarter training is just imagine the cross entropy loss for all the power that you have you simply add an extra talking in the sentence that specifies the target language but you want to the only thing that I wanted to add on this is that oftentimes it types if you hypnosis today done by I'm not sure if you learn about wedding centerpieces essentially ways to segment syllabus or frequent you come this data in order to learn this ways to segment the data than it's also possible that for many languages there is a good fraction of dictionary that is shower social hubs making sure that Edwards arm call languages at 1 safaris that even without the main effect start training paradigms depend on the available data that you have sorry it's very hard to tell which metal works best nowadays because it's really bad you have what is the language that you're working they may be very different but if you have a lot of data maybe we have game legions The Noisy coding by translation nowadays the field is we're trying to figure out the best way to come the lotto that's my ship what's the best combined rapping trying to automatic vs because there is a lot of cross validation with say to all this er the diversity of the main dealing with datasets very translation quality some are very noisy very clean different datasets for different size language pairs so I would say that in China or maybe country into it eBay translation does it mean models on small data assamese training even bigger models on even more data because you need to compensate for the lack of supervision before I go on other any questions I just had a quick question regarding in the previous algorithms that you describe necessary to retrain entirely can you turn the model entirely or is there some way to augment the model or fighting it on the as we three more than bigger the parallel not much data and so you need to bring in something small otherwise you worry too much data this R18 auto candy must be your than your reasonable super obvious how to Liza beer mother from this morning model that's why people usually around them directions you can nice from the mola adebisi Direction we usually finest initialising at random usually thank you usually the model lunch or I was wondering do you mean did you add more layers at the moment amateurs or as the morning peeps training usually you just make it bigger whether it is wider or deeper pink usually I'm not entirely sure there is a definite answer on the Korda deeper is a good thing doesn't value match so usually play with the encoder I would say there is no difference can you just double the size of your penis let's see how this I didn't speak about Maurice but I spoke about you can turn them into more and talk about distribution it's just entertainment in cancel because we implement them so let's see how the fibres can be put together in some interesting studies so actually I realise that I'm really going to slow so let's see you only have one ring me later and no parallel data so this is what we call unsupervised machine translation say that you have an English and a French stick this is not a typical use cases of her supervisor mission station where this is where it was silly well Focus for this phone now you take a sentence from the target seminar you go through your Inca recorder and you produce in English I don't have the reference yet who is to feed these two play some seasoning that goes from English to French and I reckon started your reason open sentence and now you have you can have another signal to propagate through you are going from English to French to English that's what people have done in by The Psycho sister so you can see this as an intermediate representation is is a language in English is that the mother is not constrained to produce something that is fluent English sentence people use anniversary of training back in and cannot take it because this is this sequence make sure that this decoder produces English sentences to do so you could you can take an English sentence knows if I go through your order is the same doctor that you appear what's the learn statistics that I can order it is of the English language is that if you look at this dick order open coding game it is operating on the awkward of this encoder that English as well princess very well be the case that the representation produced by these two encoders is diff work very well but not in this store other ways how can we make sure that this blue blocks are interchangeable we make sure that there is good motility so one way to do this is to use the straight away used for Matalan training but I will have a single order Dakota and South Dakota is shared across French and English shared across English and French by the target Language by an extra token in particular if you learn thank you shared parameters down sorry this process really works well and you having little bit weird whenever it is bad with the heat Estate accounts from an encoder operating an English or French ingredients are iterative back translation in Ireland closing and multilingual training machine translation with bath installation in online manner whereby what a given me b Beckenham station play Disturbed the model you could let that one that works Leicester when you do this on English friends you find you can get pretty good performance blue after usually case you're pretty fluent translation sitar if you convert that to what you guys with the supervised baseline that is training on the dataset you find that 10 million monolinguals sentences in English and my nan friends the same supervise baseline that is this this Redcar this look around this is the euro version this is the place example sentences so sentence ST200 monolinguals sentence in the sense that they give you system of similar the more the domain server different in the Moor is are different from each other let's play when you do low resource machine translation this is the extreme case of unsupervised machine translation you need to learn from in order to compensate for the lack of supervision maybe give you an example on florist where Doris lessing there was no in domain parallel data single data that was in the main but not very much and there was quite a bit of autumn after the main data play when your sentences come Bible and we have quite a bit of wondering more data that is after the main this is a supervised baseline why is machine translation of hair didn't work at all because like was mentioned knock wa and so this doesn't have unsupervised machine translation Beckham station to do it ready by concessions want to be better than the supervisors bassline white I'd also English Hindi parallel data you do quite a bit better and now also unsupervised machine translation works it's a supervise for in English Nepali but you do her supervision for English indeed the combination of translation and what training is here the winning company something that we see through in general English Burmese I had a nice time but I'm going to show it to you later if there is time and so we have quite a few good components buying pretty easily Ronaldo research is about how to pass combined and how to Bestway datasets how to best weight examples in order to automate Homebase Broadstairs the other message here is the translation is a big data problem equals by computer it's a pretty big Insignia in feet in order to compensate for the lack of questions on this just wondering when you mentioned that the parallel to vision in cycle consistency that we can do adversarial training when you get flushed out and why we couldn't just use analysis and yes yes there are a bunch of papers trying to Drew training or training for a destination active researcher I haven't seen a very compelling demonstration that this matters work by which try a little difficult to back up again so when this produces a sentence you need to produce that's the Peppa Pig using rainforest candle a lot of these things by a century what is very finicky simple scale another another consideration is that anything that you do has to work as again the value you must have information that you got from their sentence is not very much start the computer if you or is your grandson guys I like when you ring with rainforests then is not going to work possible that people may come up with ways to make it to a present but I could be in the future can you spend 5 minutes on the analysis and then you look at this light so you can go over the remaining the starting point is to say if I want to simulate low resource machine translation with the hardest language like French to English you have ac2100 sentences very nice Facebook can you try this on Facebook data the improvement is very very many more relates to the discussion that we had a union that wore people talk about in different parts of the world is very you need like you need for line 2 large by the distribution point flowers is very very different from Italian so it's very difficult to align them where was Mickey example that even for English speaking countries if you look sports you have that people talk more about football in the UK stop it you have a different distribution also have different topics what's mother called the source target domain mismatch herault kinds of Romanians epically you have distribution and the Test review what's the body mismatch between the source source language the source domain and the target this is that this may make battlestation less effective because you were to perfectly Translate once you translate it is going to be the data that you really want to translate with originating the source to me very nice contrasting to study this problem we create a synthetic dataset where the source domain transfer diamond data in the target domain cars from opensubtitles which movie captions by creating the target domain as a mixture of the two you can precisely control the amount of this between the source and the target domain you came very that and so the matter is all is this figure how much little me singer with a sore stomach so if I was able to 1-year old Europa and galleries opensubtitle solid that in these 16 regime set training which is this red line works better than bathroom place you make the dumbest more and more similar translation is much better than Saturn them are much better than just if you were to use the parallel people of this you can look at the paper and the slides conclude that there are other things that I didn't talk about like featuring this is one of the most exciting things nowadays joint embedding space for sentences is it raining in multilingual system on lots of public available data please another to do nearest neighbour retrieval of a sentence station would be in other languages dafont large data set and they were able to be the performance of state-of-the-art play some System on hydrasource languages like English German English Russian by using much more data noisy you can do better than using accurate high quality and this is something that we say over and here is that we need to figure out how to best combine battlestation this training in order to the bus number for sorting office in Broughton I just want to maybe I should include here Michael Peterson by telling you that if you have any questions about this letter you can always email me drop me a line I'll be happy to follow my love we have a lot of opportunities from internships to full-time positions as a research scientist in your so if you're interested or curious just was so drop me and thank you it may be there store few people that might have questions and just a few more minutes to questions I love you a little more about the models interviews go back to the post office today are you something like but you take me to like and dropping the word or switching words to be able to make an old monitor Rye four back translation where yes what's a century accent golden X my ass and sofa cleaning do you fantasize the target can you fantasize the input say all this matter says away in Portugal battlestations recent play Summer people doing vision in the sense that the transformations now is produced by a band objective of Rising by ending a lot on noisy how are one and one we will you change the input and then enforcement training the way that he wants is that you take the cleaning through our machine Translation system at the previous iteration hi Judy call with be more with other matters and you got a prediction for what the label should be that's now you're reference the weather in your machine Translation system used by noisy finding but so you had nice to your input and the noises you drop Wars you swap words dark what is the same the prediction and Andy started you tried to tie them together as much as poss is a very what are the first sign of supervised learning matters that you find in the national community there are a lot of variants of this where they have props community of experts that produces the radiance of the Seas makes another sense particularly for a symmetric task you do text classification if you do summarisation then that translation is not really applicable because off label impetigo difficult task what's the weather like for many to one mapping setting is definitely definitely works sewing machine translation when there is a lot of the main is match between the source and the target Express possibly set down in general what works best because you really bands pants on the ground question they like to ask sleep in maybe not getting another immediate question and I guess we have gone for the end of the time bring it to a close thank you so much my carelio I mean I really enjoyed their and I you no speaking as someone who did work in machine translation for decades I haven't so much the last few years I mean you know it actually still seems to me just amazing how successful you can build things and with these Morrowind 0daydown using ideas like the bed translation I mean it's just incredible with translation systems now and you know obviously something that isn't just on academic interests as you might realise if you thought about it if you got a company like Facebook data play very far from you stayed out what the Bible and in communities of speakers this matters are pretty channel so we applied and to summarisation Q&A style transfer it's really beautiful that it's a setup I'm in places and it's all about supervision of correspondence thank you thank you bye-bye
