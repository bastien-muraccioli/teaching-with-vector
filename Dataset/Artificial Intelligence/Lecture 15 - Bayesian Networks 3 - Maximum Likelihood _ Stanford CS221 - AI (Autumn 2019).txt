ok let's get started again so before I proceed to busy now as I'm going to talk about a few announcements so as you probably know car is due tomorrow progress is due Thursday and then finally that kind of big wind is the exam which is next to so everyone if you're in the room were watching in from home please remember to go to exam example cover all the material from the beginning of the class up until and including today's lottery so aubergine networks no large doesn't mean you should use logic our reviews are going to be in section of this Thursday and Saturday so you get not one but two reviews Sessions the first one what talk about a reflex and state-based models and the second will talk about your voice model on at this point all the alternative exams having schedule if you can't make the exam for some reason then please come talk to us right now and just a final notice that the exam is the Proms are a little bit different than the homework problems the require more and problem-solving and the best way to prepare for the cameras to really go through the exams and get a sense for what kind of problems and questions are gard where is the Saturday sun does anyone know we don't know yet will be posted on plotter any other questions about anything I know this is a lot of stuff but this is probably going to be the busiest and then you getting scared brakes old ok so what's jumping so two letters that go with sorry introducing occasion at work so bayesian networks is a modelling paradigm where you define a set of variables which capture the save the world can you specify dependencies depicted as directed edges between the variables and giving the grass structure then you proceed a defined distribution so first you define a local conditional distribution for every variable given the parents so for example H give and CNA and I given a and then you slam all these low conditional distributions aka factors together and they find our glorious joint distribution over all the random I think about the joint distribution as the source of all truth is like a proper site database oracle that can be used to answer queries in the last lecture we talked about algorithms for doing problematic inference where are your giving a patient at work which defines this florist joint distribution and your ass a number of questions and questions like this condition on some evidence which is a subset of the variable that you observe what is the distribution over some other subset of the variable observe then we look at a number of different algorithms in the last lecture there is a form of background with them which was useful for doing filtering and smoothing queries in HMS this was an exam Aaron then we look at particle filter in which happens to be used for in a case where your state-space numbers are the values that are variable can take on it can be very large this is an approximate but in practice at 10 Sevilla good approximation I'm in the final a particle filtering which sorry which is this much more general a framework for doing products in France I'm arbitrary Factor graphs in this was again at so far away with a bit of two pieces of this Marlene in France learning triangle with talk about models with talked about inference algorithm and find me today we're going to talk about learning answer the question in learning as we've seen a repeatedly it's rather star course is where do all the premises come the so far we have assumed that someone just Hands you this these local conditional distributions which are have numbers still down when in the real world where do you get this and we're going to consider accepting where all these parameters are known and we have to figure out what they are from price of the Robot Wars going to start first start with supervisor learning which is going to be the easiest case and then we're going to move to unsupervised learning where some of the variables are any questions before we die ok w Stewart so the problem of learning as follows were given training data and we want to turn this into practice Castle through the specific instance of bayesian networks 20 data looks like an example is an assignment to older very ok this will become clearer in the exam the parameters are all those local conditional probability now as soon we so here's a question which is more computationally more expensive for patients is it problematic inference given are the parameters or learning a primary school and so how many of you just use your intuition how many of you think it's the former influences more 1 Movie how how many you think learning is tomorrow yeah that's probably what you would think right because learning seems like there's just more an ounce and a can alcohol it turns out it's actually so good this will hopefully be a relief to many of you because I know probably and friends gets a little bit I quite intense sometimes I am learning what actually be moving out quite a walk in the park but a brisk stroll and then when we come back to answer priority as going to get hard again so at least in a forest supervised selling a easy and so what I'm going to do now is coming to build to the general Alvin on Fire series of examples of increasingly complex spatial so here's the world simple has Wonderboy in it what's the standard variable represents the rating of a movie so I take some values 125 and to specify the local conditional distribution you just have to specify the probability one the problem with the problem with three probably for improbably cancel these five number represent the parameters division pay by filling these I can get different disc suppose someone hands you this train observe which means I observe what time I reserve the value of r 2 by 1 the second day of observe the value to be free third observeit before install hello this is your so now the question is how do you go from the training data here to the premise any ideas mezuzah and then divide or not ok so this is seems a very natural intuition later or justify why this is a sensible thing to do for now let's just use your God and see how far and the probability of some value of Irish should be proportional to the number of times that occur in this particular example I look at all the possible values of R125 in a jc-1 shows at once 2 shares of 0 time 4 shows up 5 times in summer so these are accounts of the particular size of r in the night simply normal personalisation means adding the council gather which gives you 10 / which gives you after frizzy hair ok so let's go to two variables so now you improve your model of Reading so now you take into account of genre is a very dodgy which can take on two values drama or comedy and the reading is the same before now let's draw the simple bayesian network which has two variables I'm and the local conditional distributions are PSG a Barca sodium I'm going to give you some training data with specific training example specifies of force I meant all the variables so this case it's D4 and this one it's 34 again on this one c one in Apprentice here are their local condition on this switches pfg a are given ok so let's proceed to do this and hear from your nose again we're going to ask each local conditional distribution sete it's all this is me not the obvious wife separate is the right thing to do but trust me it is the right thing to do in Stirling just ok so again if we look at BFG do we have to look at only the state of restricted to G and we see that Dee shows up three times she shows up twice so get discounts analyse and that's my estimate of the probability of and now let's look at other conditional distribution are given to you again I'm going to count the number of times that these variables are g&r shower so D4 shows a price D5 shows up once I am someone count anomaly question boundary of power with any differences in the results what happens if we the opposite Direction Where We a r POV agde so then you would be esimene different probabilities europeus mean if you of our which contains 125 and then IG giving off so the question is if you do in France do you get the same result I'm in this case you will get the same results in general your now are you depending on the model you defined you're actually going to get it distributes which vol to differ this happens when you have two variables and you couple them together and you do things like this way I from the space of our joint but with you have a conditional independence and you have for example H&M daughter how you write the mold alright so so far so good so now let's add another variable Esso so now we have a variable which represents whether a movie won an award we're going to draw this Asian Network the joint distribution is PGP g so this type of structure is calling the structure for obvious reasons and this remember was moschino tricky This is the Thing Alicia explain your way I'm also tricky things in bayesian networks it turns out when you're doing learning in and it's actually all the trickery so I'm let's just do the same thing as before so we get the state each day of 4 time into all available so this is d03 corresponds to gcode add an equal 0 and equal 3 and the parameters are all getting all the local conditional distribution I'm in now I'm going to Carlton on lies so this part was the same as before counting the genres d shows up three times features of twice normalise a is treated very much the same way so 3 movies have won no Awards to movies have one award so they probably already movie William 5 and they finally this is the local conditions distribution of our given g&a and here we have to specify for all combinations of all the variables mentioned in that local condition distributes weird the number of times that configuration shows up I'm so d01 shows up once my hair e03 shows up once right here and now when you normalise you just have to be careful that you normalising only over the variable that you're the local distribution is on in this case are for every possible unique setting of DNA I have a different issue dodie 0 that's a distribution over 1 and 3 in if I normalise I could have enough in each of these otherwise completely separate because they have different values any questions that wasn't too bad so now let's inverter V and look at this structure we're now we have genre there's no word about when it says we have two people radio move the bayesian network looks like this vagina and we have our 1 giving g&r to Givenchy every now I'm going to assume that these are different or local conditional so I have PR1 MK42 noticed and in this luxury I'm being very explicit about the local conditional here I'm in searches running pfg which can be ambiguous I'm writing few G2 refer to the fact that this is a workout conditional distribution for a very bored this one the one from our one this one for our two and those are and you see you later why this this matter ok so now we're going to go through the same motions hopefully this should be I'm fairly intruder final you simply account normalise for the PSG NN4 R1 I'm just going to look at the first well the second element here which corresponds are wine and ignore or gr1 so D4 shows up twice so I have D4 inb4 that shows a price D5 shows up once that's a D5 the wine shows a block and C5 shows normalise gamma distribution and then same for R2 now ignoring or one how many times did the equals d and R2 = 3 ok so you can think about YouTube these as I can have a pattern that you Sweep over the training set so you have the 5 so that's a 1 here auntie for that's one here and D3 how to whine 
 and then you know how many of your followers alright so now think I'm going to make things a logo more interesting so cure define different local conditional distributions for each rating variable r one but in general maybe I have R3 and R4 and R5 and have maybe 1000 people horrible in this movie I don't really want to have a separate District person so in this model I'm going to define a single distribution over radiant condition on John record PR and this is where subscribing the actual identity of local conditional distribution becomes useful and this allows us to distinguish PR from this case witches pr1n notice letter the structure of the graph remains the same so you can't tell from just looking at the Vision out you have to look at carefully at the prom ok so if I just have one PR what I'm going to do is what do you think that right I'm sorry yeah so count both of so you can buy now right so PSG is the same and now I'm going I only have one distribution I need to ask me here or given g and I'm going to count the number of times in a day where I'm using I have a particular value of G and predictive value ok and I'm going to look at both R1 and R2 sod3 shows up once so that's are too the forces of three times the one's here with Ry once you're with R1 and once you're with incel and then you can deny another way you can see this is that if I take the counts from arm these two tables I'm just having merging on adding them and then I'm normal question rip yeah so is this a swimming or something about independence so cure when I'm doing I'm assuming the data points are in the persevere and warm also assuming the conditional independence structure of conditional gr1 and R2 oh yeah sorry I'm also assuming that or one Givenchy has the same distribution Zara and this is part of the when I define the model ok so this is a general idea which I want to call out which is called a premiership and premier Siri is when the local conditional distribution of different variables use the same parameters the way to think about our Prime Minister is in terms of powering so you have this page in our work at hangout here are behind the scenes and the parameters oracle driving and you can think about the prime minister's these little tables sitting out add you connect a table off to a variable if you say this table is going to power on queso what primary sharing in this particular example saying this distribution of powers this now and these two variables R1 and R2 are going with powered by the same colour code conditional so ok I'm going to go to two more now was made rather on the board to make it's all over so remember the naive bayes model are from 2 lottery so this is a model that has a variable that represents adapted to movie genres heading we have a very bold Exxon values and then I have a movie review which represent a document with l words in it and each word is I'm trying independently and a joint probability is therefore going to be probably of x the probability of WJ given y for all words cheat show us the way to think about this raft the Vision ours is you have a variable while here and I'm just going to drive with Wyn W2 W3 add I'm going to have a local conditional distribution here which is why genre of why so that song table it's powering this now and then I have a separate one single other variable and conditional distribution of a dog why w and I'm probability of what word word I'm we giving why this distribution powers this so noticed that I'm here there's 2 local conditional distributions we have genre and we have even though they are out plus one yeah so the input what is so the question is what is the input to the word w given y so when you apply this to a particular variable in Samsung's you bind y2y and you bind w to the particular wi eww and you can see this kind of mathematical where you here we have you pass into we were WJ NJ Rangers just to cancel if I understand let me ask the following question if my can take on true values as and each word can take on I'm devalues how many primers are in other words how many numbers are in these are Two tables on dollar band street view ok and then there for every possible values for two possible values so there's 2 plus to hear and then there's a d Plus now if you were one of you fancy and Carlton number from is really need it should be less than this because if I specify the probability of see then you can one minus that problem but let's not worry ok let's do the same thing for a charms just to make sure we're on the same page here since we are like vitamins ok so in hmm remember there is a sequence of hidden variables H1 H2 H3 I'm in for each hidden variable we have I'm eating E3 which are observed and there are three types of distributions for there is arm the probability of I'm going to start of each which is going to specify the initial distribution over H1 I'm going to have the transition probabilities which I'm going to denote age cottage pie I've ordered Ryanair butrans here is Prime giving each so this is going to be another distribution which powers each transition it's 9 initial hidden variable remember these are pointing to variables and finally I am going to have distribution demission distribution are we giving each that table is going to power on each of the Observer Enduro agenda art three types of distribution start transition in emission even though there could be any number variables in injustice be very clear about this when I apply this table to this no binds to H1 an h28 prime Bynes 202 and then when I apply to this note H20 an itch price biased again you can see this form formulas where I'm passing into peachman HIB vantage high - 1 as I switched from 22 so you can think about this is like a little function with local variables the argument to that that function RH and is Prime but when I actually called function stories when to find the joint distribution and passing in the actual variables of the any questions this ok maybe to summarise some Concepts first we talked about learning as the generically the problem of ego from data parameters and data in this case is for Simon's to all the random variables in hm case it's of a data point is Simon to all the hidden variables and observed variables prime minister's read another is all the local conditional distributions which artists are three tables in the arm the key intuition is Celta normalize which is intuitive and labour or justify why this is an appropriate way to do parameter estimation arm and then finally parameter sharing is this idea which allows you to define huge patient network I'm not have to blow up the number 4 because you can share the Promise between the different Chanel let's talk about the general case so hopefully you understand the basic intuition so this is just going to be some abstract notation that's gonna count song so in a generation our by variables X1 Direct and we're gonna see the parameters are a collection of distribution Sophie l p a sub-d ok and so big d is going to be the set of types of hm case it's going to be three types start trans enimed so basically that's the number of these Lovebox I have an the joint distribution when you define amazing out is going to be the product of p of XI given x parents of this is the same as we had before Renown noticed a crucial difference which wind in red hair is that I'm subscribing this pee with a Dr ok so what di for the eyes variable size is which of these distributions is powering that sody this variable is image die of this variable is a transition in the of the spirit so this is lyrics maybe I'll be abstract I'm notational but that ideas just to multiply in the probability is that was used to generate michonne just means that the eye could be the same please please if we only have one mission distribution why do we need so many of this replica arm and the reason is that variables represent and the object locations at a particular time so the value of this is going to be FaceTime what time but the mechanism for generating that very boys just like if I flip a coin 10 times I don't have one distribution that represents the probability of heads but I have 10 realisations aubade another analogy that might be helpful is a real diesel premid of my funk in the programme that you can call why does like a sore thumb add sorting is just used in a whole bunch of different places but it's time the same local function that are Power different use cases Pacific today ok so in this general notation what is learning look like so the trainer is set of 4 Simons and I want output the premises so here is the basic form it's cult and no Encounter and there's just a bunch of for Loops over each I'm training example which is Exeter for Simon I'm going to look at every variable I'm going to just increment a counter which are of the the DDA distribution of this particular configuration experiment science and then in the normalisation step I'm going to consider all the different types of distributions and then I'm going to consider all the possible local assignment to the parents and I'm going to normalise on so the di refers for the eye farrow-ball which red table lamp ok so I've given you already bunch of examples so hopefully this the notation macular Babs Shrewsbury hopefully you guys are any questions the main point of the sliders just to say that this is very genuine I just didn't do it hidden Markov models and I present ok so now let me come back to the question of why does cloudy normalise paralyses some made up procedure so why is it a reasonable thing to do this is actually based on very Fermanagh Foundation princess is ID of a maximum like which is an idea from statistics that says if I see some data in a have a mod overlay did I want to quit the premises to me the probability of idea that as highest possible so in symbols what it looks like is I want to find the parameters Tina the remember primers are probabilities in the read tables on the board I'm in then I'm going to lockout make the product of all the training examples probability of Dad every possible setting of the printers I can ask Allah signs particular probabilities to might rain examples in I want to make that an appointments at alderman previously exactly computers Max and likely Ian close which is really nice do you think about when we talk about machine learning with the final last one new car computer and you have to use the Casa Granada sense to automize here it's actually much simpler because of the way that the models setup you just call the normalising that is actually autumn so just because you write down a Max doesn't always mean you're happy is a is a Latin ok so let me I'm not gonna prove it and generally but I want to give you some intuition why this is and hopefully connector canva the abstract principle with Underground I'm out of cannon so suppose we have attributable Asian Network with Jonah Andre so I have three data points here Armin I have this maximum likelihood principle which I am follow and let's using algebra Harris I'm going to expand the joint distribution this solution is just a product of all the local conditional distributions arm and I've also expanded this know the product over these three instances so I have the probability of die premier forgiven probability of die here probably a 5 given I'm probably have see I'm probably a 5 given see what a maximizer over here right now a distribution of version can I have a distribution of raiding condition on vagina and see and the distribution of Reading ok so I've colour-coded these in a certain way to emphasise that the all the red touches what is the local condition description course corresponds to probability of are reading given general d and Rana probably training given general cause c crystal now I can shuffle things around and I noticed that this Archers don't actually depend on probably so they can just hang out of here hello is this in this likewise if I'm thinking about the maximum over you're giving see all these other factors are just constants so basically reduces a problem three independent maximiser ok and this is why I could take local conditional distribution in turn and do counter normalised on ok and then the rest is actually to do it actually properly you have to use the grand multipliers to solve a bad intuitively hopefully you can either do that or just believe that if I ask you what is the probability best way to set probability so that this quantity is maximise I'm going to set on probably 2/3 and probably of Seagulls is a similar to one of the questions on foundations I remember only 4 I'll probably so hopefully something you can now a rest sleep a night thinking that if you do caramelized you're actually you're being some I'm high find a printer ok so let's talk about a lot faster here's a scenario if I have give you a coin and I said I don't know it's probably heads but you flip 100 times and 23 times 1077 times 8 tails what is the maximum likelihood estimator in the yeah so it's going to be probably of head is counting on is 23 over 100 which is 3 probably of tails is point so risible rhyme Florida so you flip a coin once and you get head what's a proverb the maximum microwave says 1 and 0 you know something you're probably thank you and smiling and you probably think this is a very Close management I just because you saw one has ok the probably of heads must be one tails is impossible because I never signed so Sims 3 foolish anytime you feel like well kills Mike Hammer no sometimes so it shouldn't be a StarKid 10 this is an example of overfitting which we talk about in the machine actually wear maximum likelihood well tentative maximize the probability and hear it does maxymiser probably because the price of days now wine and you can do better than that but this is overfilling so we want to I'm more reason I ask who's wearing a plaster and again I'm going to introduce the past movie are from cannabis fire knows Canada American Dad I'll talk about why am I great ok so who is maximum likelihood I'm just a number of times that occurs over a toll number 12 you have so the fast-moving is just adding some numbers so this is a plaster named after a famous French mathematician who are there more than and numbers transform and plastic but where are you going to use the park about I'm adding numbers I'm so so here in red I'm showing there for this problem no matter what the data is I'm just going to add a 1 I don't care what they like I'm just got out of one I'm going to divide by the total number of value RR pusha possible with just two heads in 40 years and also can add a wine I don't care what the date is I'm in I'm going to do pressing how I get to 1001 which trivia more no sense of internally sensible if you're going to come up with any it has so probably more than 50 present it's going to be heads bad probably not 100% ok so let's look at sorry I'm more complicated settings so here have two variables and Laplace movie is driven by a prandle Lambda on which by default is going to be one but I can be any number 0900 number I'm and what Laplace smoothing amounts to is saying start out with your tables in a set of filling and with 0 build am Westland so here is my table before even look at the daytime just going to put one now when I look at my data and just going to add to that counter sodi shows up twice seashores of once in accounting same over here before any look at any day I'm just going to populate with ones which is Landor and then I get my 3 data points in a add the 3 counters which are shown here in Italian so bye construction no eventually have probably 0 on because I always start with wine wine / some puzzle numbers the general idea is for every distribution in Portugal Simon I'm going to add Lambda to that count and then I'm just going to normalize to get the property Aston imitation of Laplace smoothing is essentially no pretending that you saw lander occurrences of every local Simon even though you don't seem your day hallucinating this sometimes it's called Sarah cancer virtual count arm and the more higher Lambda is the more hallucination or more smoothing you're doing that will draw the probabilities closer to the uniform distribution another extreme landing pro 0 is simply maximum likelihood your ditto I Windsor so if you had Laplace smoothing and you say one head and now you saying estimating the problem what suppose you keep off looking at school it keeps on coming up heads 998 oh x then by doing a similar past moving you're going to eventually update you're probably 4.9 you never going to reach 1 exactly because no problem good is are going to be every 01 but increasingly you're going to be more tomorrow confident that this is a very very any questions about the plot movie glass movie is just on outlander to everything NR so sorry I forgot the principle behind a plaster movie is if you thinking terms of this is County on discover this course but you can think about a prior over your promises which is some uniform distribution and on instead doing maximum likelihood you're doing map or maximum a Presto estimate so there is another principal but you don't have to worry question is how did you make Lambda it's a good question so one is vanity small is probably shouldn't be like on probably should be more like mine or even you can make a laugh 0 grenson arm how I guess uncertain in general these Priors are meant to capture what you know about the ok alright so now we get to the fun park and this is going to inserm sounds combined learning which we done with problems France 4 and the motivation here is that what happens if you don't observe some of the variable so far learning has assumed that we observe complete assignment to older and variables but in practice is just not true the whole reason people colmcille Markov models that you don't actually have the hidden States so what happens if you only get darts one of this simple example what happens if the dealer looks like this where we observed the ratings for we observed what can you do so obviously the counter normalising doesn't work you can count with so there is two ways to think about what to do here the high minor principal is computer maximum likelihood and make it work for unobserved variables and the other wait I think about her which I'll come to later is simply guess what the lion guard was R and then and as these two are going to be a so let's be home I'll it for now and think about what maximum marginal like so in general were going to think about each as the hidden variables and he is observed variables in this case g is hidden and R1 R2 are observed suppose I see some evidence ESO icr-1 equals one or two close to I don't see the value of the primers all the same the same as before I just have data or information to ok so if you're following Max and white what is maximum likelihood say is theirs Twitter primary so that the likelihood of your data is as largest possible what is the likelihood of a daycare it's simply instead it's any I have probably believe so this seems like a kind of a very natural sound extension of Max and Michael I'm in a call maximum marginal likelihood because arm this quantity is a marginal likelihood right it's not a joke likely joint distribution the marginal distribution over only a subs ok so now to unpack this a bit what is this marginal distribution is actually oh bye axioms of probability it's the summation over all possible values of the hidden variables of the joint another word you can think about maximum likelihood is saying I want to change the properties in such a way that such that the probability what I see is highest possible that real requires me to do is think about all the possible values add-on edgcote I don't see it so I had to consider what ifs 1 and 3 were see what if you were doing no was fundamentally if you don't have server variable you have to consider possible Valley alright so now let's skip to the othersyde the kind of scrap you weigh and think about what is a reasonable hour and I'm not gonna have time tennis courts so cannot show the formal connect have you taken your cs228 or graphical models class go into this and much more I'm so the intuition here is the same as what we had was came in so remember classroom you don't know the the centroids and also don't know the Simons so you it's a chicken egg problem so you go back and forth between figure out word for Central and figure out what the bus time Anna centralizata going to be an analogue parameters here and assignments are going to be the analogue the Hindenburg so here's our call expectation-maximization it was in a formalized in a stunning happily in the in the 70s and you start out with some primers maybe initializing to uniform uniform Plus noise and then it's going to alternate between two stops and I'm sad and if you is useful to think about the caymans in your head going through this out so my step we're going to guess what the hidden variables or what the values of the intervals so we're going to define the queue of age which is going to be our representatives is this wearing probably land were going to consider the distribution over all possible values of h this Gas is going to be given by or current setting of parameters and the evidence observing our fixing asking the question what is the probability of the hidden variables taking on particular rise of a data and giving my promise this should look kind of familiar what is this there's just politics in France right which we've been doing for the last which means that you can use any problems with inference algorithm that's got a summer job you need to do I'm here ok so now what happens what if we have our selling of debt over the possible values age now we arm makeup data to recreate wa88pt arm with particular values of 8 each of them get some weight or cures and then finally once were given his way to points now we're just going to use r to Cavan online walkthrough an example to make this allowed them more grand so I'm going to do this on a poured because it's going to get a little bit maybe a little bit hairy what's this secure we have a free variable no work so we have Amistad over here actually might need a space we are one MR2 ok and your data that we see is we get data which is 22 and one observe two two that's one day and I want you that's another I'm so initially what I'm going to do is arm start with some celapram so I'm going to start with my branders Taylor which specify a distribution of worth lack of information I'm going to consider just half and half initialising music with a uniform distribution my other table here is going to be and also probability are Givenchy interior I have c the possible values of the possible values are for simplicity I'm going to assume to just be one and two I'm in the and for this I have these numbers 4.6 .6 for 4 I'm not sending them to uniform ombre Italian opentable Canada check the alarm the numbers on a boiler the same as another ok so that my initial friend now in East Ham any news this promise enter castle ok so what is this water I'm so for each possible data point so for every example so I have to to that's one data point I'm going to try to guess what about you BBC army can we do holiday 2.12 it also could be c or could be and now I'm going to try to computer word for each of these data based on the model ok so the wait is now look at this is called right because I have a complete assigned I know what to do with completes assignments I can just wait the product ok so now I'm churches to make things concrete positive g x probably fr1 given she probably of to giving g this is a definition that probably Siri what's the weather this is joint distribution by definition of the original work ok so how do I compute the product or the of this configuration well it's a probably of you so look at this table I can get .5 times the probability of our one Givenchy that's to and see so we look over here that's a .6 and then another R2 Givenchy that's also eternis the Premiership and that's our point let me to slide to you guys can check my ok so now I look at this table so probably = d .5 and then probably Armani coats to Givenchy close to live looking this table that's 0.4 and then I have another point for another 2 in that is 0.8 and then I can normalise this question so why is this point 4 vs .6 year this is because I initialise the parameters so that the probability of articles to giving speakers Diaz point why do I use this initialisation just for fun I just made it up just so that if I had put .50 then you couldn't wait hours going on and also arm as a side market Witham your work initialisation it is generally going to be random but as close to uniform get so this is this is coronavirus going to be the problem audio basically equals to rr1 = r wine R2 = 0 turn down the queue is going to just be is just going to be the way of this normalising is to which means you at them up and you divide and then you get on with a .69 and 31 so the number there are little bit kind of awkward that's why I'm not going to do the second row but it's basically the same question particle filter inlet the question is is expectation-maximization because you're on your way arm actually it's quite different I mean there is sounds like there's some armed proposing different options but certainly the two others are meant to solve very different task one is for learning a 1 is 4 I'm probably ok so what's look at the em step now ok so the m stop how are you guys feel the same stop actual when you do them over here is going to now just take these examples so these waiter .5 it's like someone handed you fully labelled data complete observations 4 point but each observation has a wave the only difference between counting normalise instead of just adding one whenever you see a particular computer configuration you can add the ok so pretty each other parameters and going to look at so this is going to be g probability of G so this CD c or d arm and to get this I have wanted first let me hear I look at my data so so this is now my kind of dating quotes because I don't actually hallucinated these are the waves which are city with the devil so now I'm going to look at look at GFC dicey see here see here and I have the weights 0.69 69 + appoint 5 probability ass and then 4-dicarboxylic here that's .3 wine 5:30 normalises and I'd admire piscine exactly what I did here I can analyse and I'm going to do this table open oil pastel you have to estimate for all possible Simon this case is only one variable in the next example which is going to be in hidden Markov model all the variables and we're going to see how play briefly how we get the values in the 1700 the second table with this one yeah sure just briefly so you look at these data points NUC rc1 ok so where is The One Show digico car1 = 1 here so that's a .5 and then what about C2 what is SITA show at C2 shows up twice here with R1 and R2 so that's why there's 2 of 4.690 and I see two shows up once here with always a point yeah everything here these counts are based on the table from alright so let's do something I will have fun so they could be or safer is this 105 page encrypted volume that was discovered people dated back from the 17th so looks like this so it's unreadable because it's actually a safer it's amen I'm in for decades people trying to figure out what is the actual message that was inside this It's Alive I'm in in finally in 2011 somebody touches actually crack is code and I actually used the M2 help so I'm going to give you a can of toy version of using them to do the site turns out that this code is basically some book from a secret society which you can go read about so substitution ciphers a substitution cypher consist of a substitution table which specifies for every in bladder sing we have only 26 right now eyesight for blood and the way you apply substitution table is you take up playing which generally is unknown if you're trying to decipher I can't know that they have a world and you look up each layer in a substitution table when you write down corresponding so H maps to NC right NY maps to MC ride on my so someone did us and then they are really didn't give you the point text they give you the ciphertext and so now all you have is a ciphertext obviously didn't give you the solution table either I have this the Cyber attack when you're trying to figure out decipher a substitute table and also the plant Soho parramatta something an let's try to mould as a hidden Markov so here the hidden variables are going to be the characters in the plant acts this is the actual sequence that the hello world M&M reservations are the characters of a cell so familiar quiz and the joint distribution of the hidden Markov model is given by this equation add we want estimate the parameters which include pstar trans ok so how do we go about so we're going to approach this in a arm slightly different way I guess there simply just running because we have additional structure so the probably of start I'm away is austerity uniform the the probably of transition this is interesting so normally if you doing I'm your no the problem but because we know that's how we know that the underlying tax was English we can actually ask them the probability of a character giving a previous English character from just English text what is the score because it allows us to hopefully simplify the problem I should maybe comment that in general supervisor is really really hard and just because you can write down about your equations doesn't mean that work it's very hard to get it to work so you want to get as much can a supervision order information is UK ok so finally admit is the substitution table which were derived from so now this might not have check in your head because of substitution specifies forever ladder 1 other ladder the cypher letter but in order fit into the spring work we're going to think about a distribution over possible site alladice giving up with intention awhile no it's doing a job you can always put I probably one I'm the actual sex just used my back away from the formula them why might you think this could working in general this is not obvious that it should work but but what you have here is a language model play transition which tells you and what point tax looks like right if you generate a site for a new this is my site and you'll get some Garbage then it's probably not we have some information about what what's like when you solve a puzzle you know when you have salt and then finally we also have this emission that tells us that eat a letter that he has to go to can it be substituted in the same way you going to completely different things appoint ok so so for doing estimation hmm were going to use the Emma weather and remember in Easter budgeting problems like in France and we start a Ford back where it gives us probably in particular gives you for every composition I'm going to give you my gas which is a distribution of a possible cylinder so remember age position I observe decipher a letter and I'm going to get a distribution over the point Astley Eminem's app I'm just going to count and normal as we did once I've got the cypher letters I can just computer products on sofa light I'm actually going to call this up and see so you can see it an act ok and we have five minutes or so make a square ok so here we have ciphertext I'm working at decryptors decipher and then we also have our text original song English tax salary I'm in then I'm going to decipher so there's some utilities which are going to be useful so things for reading tax converting them things into integers normalization of wait and the most important leaders implementation of a 4 backward algorithm because I'm not going to try to do ok so what's initialized vitamin and then later began around so the instrument parameters or the screen restart I'm probably which is p in our location Bombardier start this is going to be one over the number of possible letters here 4 this is just a uniform distribution 1 and I should say ok what is 6 + 1 so this is lower case letters plants ok so now we have our transition probabilities I'm going to this is going to define the distribution of feeling very bored an extra variable given previously mirror I noticed that the order is reversed here because I want a first condition on H1 and then this thing is going to be at this trip so to do this I'm going to first remember my strategies I'm going to use the language model so I'm going to have I'm against set things 204 it's 2 in French 4 is 1 and so this basically gives me a matrix ok back a matrix and now I'm going to get my raw text on I'm going to read it from allander train which remember look like this and I'm going to convert this into a sequence of integers where they're going to be 0 to 2 - 1 and then I'm going how do I estimate a transition I Can't Help It All Away so I'm going to go through this sequence and and I'm going to count every successive transition from one character to another and I'm going to so I'm going to add position I I have a character which is road tax one another it's too I'm just going to incrementalist and finally I'm going to normalise distribution so I'm transition-property for every it's wine am I have I have a transition counts of each one and I can call them open online functions exorcist review shinrone this is just doing for your observed to maximum likelihood normal I'm just alright so now emission probs this is going to be probably oven mitts I'm going to just initialise these two uniform because I died I'm so one of her K4 onion range 4 so just happens that both their hidden variables in observed variables have the same to me that's not generally the case so now I'm ready to run again so connect to China iterations just putting a number arm so have Easter in Amsterdam Easter remember I'm going to policy conference I'm going to call for a backward add remembered this is arm this is going to be basically in petition at the position I what is my distribution of the hidden States so this is actually forward backward oh I need on recent observations sorry my ciphertext sofa attacks and I'm going to convert this again into it rare arm in then have observations and then I pass in the parameters of my model and then I have my gas so let me print out what I guess it's ok so what I'm going to do here is for every position I'm going to get the most likely how come of it so you tell of art Max of QI arm for I in range and rainfall our Solutions so that gives me an array of gases for each position on and then I'm going to come for a bad into a string so it's easier to look at this is printing the best gas ok so finally for the m stop I'm going I have my rq which gives me coughs so now I pretend I have a lot your data which are worried about you so I'm going to have a mission counts equals as same as before I'm just going to get a matrix of zeros onion range 24hr and then I'm going to go through the sequence from ichor range of to the length of observation sequence arm for each position in a sequence I'm going to consider all the possible possible plaintext hidden values I'm going to increments each observations of I so this is the observation that I actually saw and this should be ui8 which is the weight of our it is at position I and then finally I'm just going to normal like what I did finishing powder builders you till dot on normalize of the counts origin that's pretty much it army this should be 4 4 ok ok so what's wrong descend then I'll go back to you let me just just one ok so we nationalized the probabilities to uniform for transition probabilities we can use the observations order just a plain text which is counter normalise any missions we initialise with uniform and then when running am weary deciphered stab we're going to use the current product parameters guess where the ciphertext is and then we're going to update our estimate of what the primers are giving or guess of what so here's the final I decipher a text and so remember each generation is when you pronounce the best gas so who will look like for a lot of bed my perfect but this is that looks someone English there's a tendon in my in there anyone can read this alone without ok that looks like English give me this like anyone that I turn anyone guess what this text who's the point tax so I've lived my life alone without anyone that I could really talk to until I had an accident with my plane in the with my whatever something summarise learning doesn't is my magic as always work but you're always something in the actual application they got part way there and then you can invite on this amount in a manual ok alright so that's great for busy networks on Wednesday was your logic
