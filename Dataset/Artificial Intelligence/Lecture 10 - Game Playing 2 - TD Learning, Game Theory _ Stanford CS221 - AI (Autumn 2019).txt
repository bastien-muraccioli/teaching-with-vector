starters so continue talking about games today just a quick announcement the project proposals or do today alright tomorrow yeah I do have not 30 tomorrow alright so games so we started talking about games last time for my son we talking about and talk about 0 song two-player games that return taking right and you talk about it won't have different strategies to solve them like I mean I tried to do and today you want to talk a little bit about learning in the sitting ok so what does learning how to learn then another workshop everyone over talk a little bit about variations of the the games you have talked about so how about you how many stars with a question that you're actually going to talk about it the end of the day good morning wishing so think about the setting we have a simultaneous two-player zero sum game so it's 8:00 some games similar to the game to talk about last time what is simultaneous so you're not to take insurance you're playing at the same an example of dad is rock-paper-scissors can you still.be Optoma if you reveal your strap what are your playing with someone you tell them what your strategy is you still be up real time travel so it's the answer was about the size of the games to rock paper scissors the question is more in the morning talk about the details the reason I guess beginning of the witches intruder when you think about her if she might say no I'm not going to tell you what my strategy is right if I say I'm going to play like you know what you play this has an interior answer that you're gonna talk about so what's the quick review of game so the worst thing we talked about having an agent an opponent playing the kitchen so and you're applying for the ages and the agent was trying to maximize agent is going to pickpocket a butterbeer but it's and opponent is going to pick a number from you they can either pick -50 or 51 or 3 or - 5 and then if you want to then you can potentially think that your opponent is trying to trying to minimise Utility and you can have this minimax game kind of playing against each other and I'm based on that decide what to do something and based on that you told you that are going to pop up or - 51 and you're going to be quite busy the second what is a pony so that was going to set up anyway it's all about solving this so we had a snail you this by which was the value of a minimum add state s and if you had your tea so if you're going to get utility we get the utility because we can do it at the very end of the game ancient is playing the recurrence is maximise me of the successor Estate is the phone displaying one minimise value that was the recurrence we started and Sara kind of words like the game of chess and think about the game of chess this is really low not practical so we start typing by wasting for speeding things up and one way to speed things up with this idea using any value so you no recurrence with all we do it until Sunday over the 43 just do it until Sunday an asteroid that just call an evaluation and hopefully your evaluation function this week estimate of your value is going to work well and give you an idea still of the usual recurrence what we did was decided to add this new idea which is the depth that until which we are exploring and then we decrease the value of the after aging and opponent please Judy believe you're playing chess for example you might think a few steps ahead and when you think a few steps ahead you might think about it looks like a kind of evaluated based on the future is dead type of idea and then the question was Will Howie going to come up with this evaluation function evaluation I don't want idea that that we talked about last time was it can be handcrafted I can come in and sit down and figure out what is a good Game of Thrones and test example is you have this evaluation function that can depend on another pieces you have the mobility of your pieces the safety of your King central control or the various things difference between the number of Queen's did you have in your phone and summer Queen features that you care about and potentially a designer I can come in and see what I care about 9 times more than I care about you can actually handle write down his wee but how much you care I'm using terminology from and someone can come in I think we can do instead of handcrafting it you could actually try to learn the sea now we can still had traffic be sure so we can still save all I care about the number of kings and queens and then I have but I don't know how much I care I actually want to wear in daddy to do that I can write my evaluation function you valve as as this week the function of state characterised by and then my goal is to figure out with you then Lisa and ideally I want to wear and Dad from something talk about how learning is applied to be specific with the way you're using learning for this game just get a better sense up with the singer the questions you might have how does view look like where does my data you know where your data comes from and your me is an all you need to do is to come up with a learning algorithm that takes your data and try to figure out what your and that kind of introduces to the temporal difference learning which you're going to discuss in a second very smart EQ learning I'm going towards the end of the class will talk about simultaneous games and total what start with this B function I just said will this new function could be privatised by and the simplest form of the function is just a function w please are the features that are hard coded and someone write cinnamon and then I just want to go this is a simplest this function doesn't seem to be any supervised learning model that the first few pictures you can be a neural network give me anything and more comfortable than that just does regression so so we can basically anymore you could use in supervised learning could be placed all I'm doing is I'm reading a function in the case of linear classifier just w the case of the neural networks are we sending to me so I think about an example and I'm going to focus on the window classifier with me so it was so we're going to help backgammon very old game it's a two-player game the way it works is you have the red player and the white player and each one of them have these pieces and what they want to do is it won't move all their pieces from one side of the other side of the word it's a game of chance you can actually like Roll To Die and based on the outcome of your life of your people various I don't want to rule so your goal is to get all your pieces after birth what if you have only like one piece and your opponent like get on top of you they can push you to the bar start again no what I wrote about it if you're interested simplified so the simplified version I have coronavirus only have 4 call have called 01283 in this case I have four of which one of these players and and your news we want to come up with feature turbot the weather temperatures number learning how do we come up who is the number of them what idea is you have all these knowledge about the word so maybe we should like about the location of the exes maybe we should care about like those are how many people are on the board how many pieces are often the first to make sure you're basically would do the same thing so feature template templates with look like this like those in Colin whatever being equal to sum value or maybe fraction of excesses or those that are removed this 44 board you are with you look at number 0121 remember using his indicator functions to be more than also like here again you're using indicator you might ask number of Us on a wireless equal to 1 fraction of hours that are so I have four pieces two of them already removed for that one citizencon 141 that's my number you have a bunch of features features tiny explain looks like or how good this morning and what we want to do if you want to figure out with it what are the way how much was a caravan that is the goal of learning so does Ellesmere park about this vww I know the question is where do I get paid I'm doing learning so what you can use here if we can try to generate data based on our current policy agent or my opponent which is based on our current estimate I might have some idea of what this might be a very bad idea but that's ok I can just start with starting with the TV function that I currently have what I can do is I can I can call ardamax of over successes of sna to get a policy for my age this was how we were getting horsey in a minute setting is just argument function and when I call his policies and interaction the sequence of Facetime me somehow your phone is faulty and that is Sunday that I can actually go over I try to make my Vita that's kind of how we do it by policies episode what question you might have at this point is deterministic or not what do I need to do something in July you would need to do something like everyone you don't really need to do that because we have a getaway you're actually growing I'm a rolling the guys you are getting random different different random pass that said we might take that will take us to different so we kind of already have this is all this year what I mean here is 22 do Alexa exploration am I going to get if I don't do expiration because we have this random general episode and then from this episode 31 is episodes look like action rewards going so I can get the full episode here is the report is going to be zero episode until the very end of end of the game episode and we might somebody that point or not but with the rewards you're not do you think about each one of these small pieces of experienced sars2 learn something from each one of you so so what you having will you have here if you have a piece of experience get a reward m 0 so Russian girls find grandma and you can show prediction where your prediction is your current your current function your prediction is going to be the with w this is your prediction I'm writing a prediction as a function of w right as it depends on you we had a target that you're trying to get to is going to be you go to my reward the reward on getting you would be of a sin w trying to get to work you playing games in games jammers usually one I'm going to keep it here for now but I'm going to drop it and then whatever things I noticed here is I'm not writing target at want to know why my waiver trying to hear that I'm trying to get too so I'm going to treat my target I just like you I'm not writing it so what do we try to do traduction what is the earliest I can write my area as one-half of prediction of w - I want to be myself respect I can take a gradient ingredients cancel is this guy wyrd time expression 100w with the gradient of predictions ew so now I have the gradient algorithm should I use so w Happy Days remove the negative Direction traduction pictures of w so flights to Hong shen is prediction by the socket squared gradient who just took that it's prediction - target and an update is a sister spreading so far so good this is the TV learning algorithm is always does so different learning what it does looks like his pieces of experience essay RS frame in and based on that experience just updates w59 difference between prediction and target what happens if I have if I have the linear function formula this indicates that I haven't renewed my SW eww so what happened to my hobby weather prediction what is Target forgetting x vs prime w WWE on Sky gradient of your prediction different yes this is very some work you learning the very minor differences that your talk about actually at the end so examples novidat and kind of saying wide work in the case that the reward is just like the episode so kind of funny use this algorithm and make it I want to just over like example I'm going to show you one episode Starting From S1 and have an episode I start from seed computers of that state in this features are about the same value eating I know just going to start what we should I start with socialise WD-40 how do I update my w mm strider dinner this is WWF previous w - 8 time prediction - tiger TNT what is my prediction WWE 0 what is my target so for my target I need to know what state I meant I'm going to episodes of word of 0 what is my time this reward which is newer what's w x of this prime now 0 p - 0 200 next forward so what is tradition here 0 play Stargate 0 because I haven't got any the target is going to be required which is 0 or 0 your best music I disappoint w hand change what is my prediction I'm going to 10 and I get a reward of 1 this is the first time I'm getting a reward which is my target my target is reward 1 what's 0 x 10 the weather's told me I'm predicting 0 with my target is 1 so I need to push my W210 likely address of practices do I need to do an update so so I'm doing starting from zero zero 802.5 eroded prediction - target is -1 what is cms you're vs1 so what is my new WB then one new W12 b.com .5 and 1 at the end of this one this isn't one episode 14 Episode 4 ws400 the very end when I got a word than updated my w because I realised that my prediction in Target so now I'm going to I'm going to start a new episode and a new episode I'm starting is going to start with this particular w&n a new episode even though the words like you're actually going to could you sleep nice representative if you really want us for a difference between then you should seek to ensure that the is going to 0 it doesn't matter in general what happened to that order French the second row I'm not gonna write it up with that takes time so ok so let's start with a new episode you started S1 again but now I'm starting with this new w that I have so I think computer predictions prediction is one I can complete my target it's .5 and we realise here is the overshoot at the before prediction was zero target was one undershooting vikkstar we went over shooting relationship between would have to be the same dimension and what you thinking about that would make a good teacher so I need to be always because you're doing this between them and the feature selection you think of it as became updating your way to think of the pictures or is it for a preventative of how good my board representative of how good and navigating northern Australia you should think I'm hoping my way how is it 21 and over extraction how is that affect the general tomorrow yes I was doing my Tuesday two different picture than one of them might be more like you might get a future that actually differentiate between different states variable within that that makes learning long you're that make a doner generalizable and on the other hand weather in Minot specific things that you want picking peaches over this quickly so we have the WS Wright also updated w based on this new Ally I'm kind of some more thing you have a prediction you have a target you're still over shooting so you still need to update it and then once you've updated 2.25 and 75 song this was just an example to you learning with this is the update that you're kind of and then the warrior pointed out that this is this is this is actually very similar to this gradients and say that you haven't you learning and then we are looking at the difference between prediction and target same way that you can get in Cuba the first difference here is that you burning operated acupuncture Uri operating on a value function and beans only that is actually cousin in the setting of a game you already know the rules of the game sometime I already know the actions you don't need to worry about it that much the same way that you're wearing the second difference is human with an alcoholic so so the values based on this estimate of the optimal policy free spider solitaire what university do you wear if an unforeseen values based on of exploration sure you're updating but you're going with whatever you have and running with Dad Lebanon and then finally I can learning you don't need to know them so you don't need to know that's fine but in the case of TV learning you need to know the rules of the game so you need to know how to success some differences from my perspective update work so so that was kind of decide your I have this function I want it from I'm going to generate data from that generated chauffeur radio using learning to play this is not a new idea actually so so in 50s Daniel's scheme program so where he was using ideas and ideas from like similar type of smart metres using linear evaluation functions to try to sort the Chequers Crowle things that he did included adding intermediate how to get to the end point use alpha beta pruning insincerity and anyone having the scheme that was playing like I was reaching like human and amateur and he only using 9 KB of memory she's like really seriously thinking learning games this was around 1970s or I came up with an algorithm to solve typically used which is the temperature for an adult pizza he didn't have any any intermediate or words used ride-on pictures for the news and he was able to reach human expert play how do I get where is oliva can you add the game of 2016 which was using a lot of expert knowledge in addition to ideas for mine and then in 2017 which wasn't using an expert knowledge it was all like to be replaced on self play it was using networks and basically the main idea was using one try to stop this really challenging go on to section you can talk a little bit how many so far is you've been talking about cancer I think is evaluation using using dftd wearing is between our prediction and our target and try to minimise that and enquire better we as we go to so that was warning in in so now I want to spend a little bit of time Viking you're bad either so we take our games to sign and then selling her We Go From Here song ok simultaneously go on safari attack about turn-based games like chess where you play in a next fireplace and you playing next I'm minimax getting strategies seem to be pretty ok all games art an example of questionnaire how do we go about solving what's 30 game that is a simplified version of rock paper scissors call the two finger more again the weird works is you have two players player a and player and each player is going to show either one thing or two things playing at The Saint what is if both of the players Show one at the same time play R&B give $2 to player what are you show 2 at the same time we are by Aspire a $4 again if you show different number is like 1 or 2 or a hazard you give $3 so can you go suck your neighbour play The Police alright what was the how many Euro in the case RH11 and Beatles mine Waitrose wine Bluetooth is to be chosen one alright so I kind of feel like a phone mixer Lucia having and this is again that you're going to talk about all think about what would be a good strategy to use when you are solving is this play Empire by yeah these possible actions are showing one or two and then you can use this payoff Matrix which your present is Utility with a Jesus action and YouTube before we had this value function right before you function over and over here now we have this value function that is again from the perspective of a day to remember looking for everything in my value function room looking at it from the perspective of the first layer the maximiser player the agent now I'm looking at all these years I'm trying to yeah this is like that you're just playing and NEC one yet so we have this week Disney of age and under specifically represent easy Turkey in a place physical representation of the Matrix and that's why it's called a payoff Matrix play off me free Asia a generic control 1 or control agent Beacon show one what's the worst one at the same time what's the weather in time region always agente has to pee the reason I only like talk about 1 we is your soul in the setting of the euro song so whatever by age and AJ vgs negative Virgin a virgin under training This is Gospel so what does a solution mean what's the weather refer to them in this case are as strategies so we have pure strategy I was like the same thing as deterministic the pure strategy is just a single action difference between pure strategy and and determines the policy if you remember that entirety you have also this is everything that has mixed strategy is equivalent to 2 stochastic healthy I wouldn't work strategies is a probability distribution what's the probability of YouTube tarot cards where is an example so if you say well I'm going to show you why I mean always show you one then the if you can ride dad strategy and a pure strategy that says I'm going to show you one and 0 play The First Time this is a pure strategy that always I'm going to I tell you what I always I'm going to show you too probably wise I will also come over if I get 1 half I'm going to give you a if I did I'm going to show you one if I'm going to show you and then you can write down as this you're the biggest game you could just bring chances the time I'm going to show you what happened evaluate evaluate so remember in we were talking about the value of someone gives me the policy how do I value evaluating something and then we're gonna ride the cellular function as a function of Pi and Pi b timer play are you reading a falling height and it is going to be the settings YouTube x value of something over all parts solicitor in actual example this 44 case of 2 let's say someone comes in and says I'm going to tell your Wifi is is just always 21 policy of agency strategy halftime show and then the question is what is the value of the what's the news 1 x 1 or 2 times the value that 0 times 1/2 x 4 1 x 1/2 ministry vol 3 0 x 1/2 Andrew 200 11 - 1/2 I just computer the value of these two houses is 40 - 1 the front perspective of ageing a any kind of makes sense right then how we did an agent who is following this mix strategy an agent is using dad opens of a cold so you might be interested in the shower just talking about this one player playing reply how do I say all what happens if 10 times what's the value of -1/2 value so so we just evaluated right if someone tells me it's fire and I can tell you if I can know how good pie and Jaime is from the perspective of Asia what do we want to do want to try to solve all we want to do is I want to get as much money as possible and it's values from my agent April 15th should be trying to maximise this should be trying to move think me Max meeting me my fingers should be lights on the challenge of your playing simultaneously so we can do a user meme marine accident in sequence shop please and then we could like play an after that play and Howard commission hero of your point the word should ok so what you do I'm going to assume return policy so I'm going to limit myself to Pure strategy right now I'm going to focus only on Pearse strategies very limited settings and see what and I'm going to feel what if what if you were to play sequentially what would happen Soham sitting there player a what do you think I could play A Rose first aider better for Priory or is it worth that's probably what where are you was trying to maximize play R&B each of them have actions of one if you do one if we show one one player Ajax otherwise for your edits - $3 who to play areas so now if we have this sequence if you're playing Mini Mac then they are bees going second For Your Babies going to take the minimiser here as this one what is a doe volume cases for getting - $3 we're at the end of the day is going to get mine this is a case for a player ages what if you're a goes s so then player beans going for minimising a is maximizing at the same is there a going second try to maximize 1 play R&B is here player by wants to minimise play abuse going to be like ok if you're going second I'd rather I'd rather show you one if I show you one show U2 dad sitting here we're going to go wire a so that was kind of strategies it looks like if you're going second actually so going s is no worse same or better and that basically can you represented by this week agente is trying to maximise the second case the second case VR maximising second over actions of the b employer so this is going to be greater than or equal to chainsmoker a sorry just things that you're learning through art the side of the board be up here so what did you just learnt or learnt have you strategies cure driver view going second is better interior angle ok the person that I want to try to think about right now is what if we have mix what's going to happen if you are we going to get this Saturday gun s divorce order the weather for where I comes in play Oasis what I want to review my strategy to you what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a coin depending on what it comes I'm either one or I'm going to tell you that the value of the game on there the value of the game with b the value I am already this mix strategy of 101 going to be equal to pi what is I'm going to be times 1 Michael Page using one I'm 181 half 80s also picking one if it is 112 IB 1 ia1 using 100 5 choosing to time is 1/2 spiby I ate using wine and I just think you rated older for auction under the policy of using one or two and then pays always what is this equal to -1/2 IBA one what's 1 over 2 someone came in and told me I'm calling this Mixtrack this is going to be what should I do it what should I do so you want consent told me all this is a thing I want to do I should try to minimise now you'll be today but I'm really trying to do at age 22 where can I buy one minimising this and trying to come up with that play the probability positive and negative 40 the way to minimise this is stupid as much weight as possible for this side and as possible for this site for that told me that never show too and always 21 that's the best thing that I can do as agent to The Bower strategies that always shows 1 this is an interesting if someone comes in and tells me this is the strategy I'm going to follow I have a solution and a solution is always going to work that this is actually what's happening in more general case setting is for any fix mixed strategy pie a so-so party told me whether strategies it's a business strategy what should you as agencies I should make my bed now you are shepherd's pie be in a way that minimises said how are you and I can you saying bye second finger I've learnt here is Earth play Ed play play mixed strategy play R&B resin optimal ok so so in this case also we haven't decided what the Parson Street been talking about the setting reply it comes in and tells us what their policy is and we know how to respond to it figure out what is this party but it would should be dismissed those I want to think I did more don't want to go back to the diagrams and actually Wi-Fi through diagrams in a way where how can I live in Morecambe go on what side and I'm going to think about it again decided to go first where is going to follow a mix mixture what is play 80s going to the poem extract where is Machen play Erasure vol it's generally saying where is going to show one with when is going to snow dunloy and then after that it's your turn you've just seen that to your be the best thing for your bacon due to do a pure strategy so clear me 100-percent is going to pick one 100% is going to take repeat turn my alarm on play pause the thing is said that the strategies are probability values from 0 to 1 and then you can always end up with this negative during that you're trying to wait as possible gas fire into why would I mean is you always end up like putting as much possible what kind of you wouldn't ever get like one and I'm saying you wouldn't because you would always end up in the sea minimise to end up pushing are you so so alright so when we will back soon storm so you have the setting of a player a ghost where is following a mixed strategy with p and 1 - PB is going to call so what's going to happen is if you have one one and then that is going to give me to value too are you here I want to speak I'm 1 - 2 the one who gonna get mine for this site what will the 1 - he is going to go to if I am going to show 24 4 times orthopedist I'm going to try to that is -3 so what are do you go to this is equal to 5 p what is equal to 70 I'm talking about this more general or general and is following a mixture at a GP doesn't know what condition choose their children apn1 and then player have to follow pure strategy that's what we decided and an under that case you'll either get 5 p - 3 and 7 what's your player BD iPlayer witches play fm104 hi Ibiza tickets the minimizer fire me going to take the minimum 5 p - 3 reminder 7 can you passport would you play a d play radio that's right so so when you think about the Munich where is maximum maximising the value the player is going to maximize in here where is automatic and also I'm saying clear on its inside you are the four different things in my payoff matrix so I'm saying he is going to show me and I'm going to go down the 11th that's the $2 come from what will the 1 - is going to show me too I'm gonna show one that's - $3 I travel that's how this would you go brown no the payoff is going to be this side again like it be probably 1 - 2 Kawasaki engines and then and then we're going to do is one or two then deciding should I pick one or two and the weather deciding that is my trying to 1 or 2 based on which one minimises but I'm writing you like I'm using this variable that's not decided yet and it's very well what what a decide whether I should decide a painted Max I'm riding with a mini Mac interesting thing here is 5 - 3 Summer Wine 5 7 peoples what is another one -70 + another one what is the minimum where is it going to be any more read my teacher the Peter I'm going to pick is going to be actually the paper the value of p for these two are equal to each other that turned out to be yes it's going to happen at 7/12 value is -1 so let's recap what did I I'm talking about the simultaneous game but I'm relaxing it and we can get free course on saying he's going to play first used playing I think that's going to happen is a sprain first is deciding to choose a mixed strategy so he is deciding to say maybe one 1:30 the thing is deciding is should I pick wine and with probability and should I take to withdraw what is the probability I should be what age is trying to be whatever a decide with p and 1 - ends up into different resort I'm based on them trying to minimise trying to minimise abuse minimising between these two renal function used to win your functions meet at one point that is the point that this thing is going to be meaning and then actually corresponds to P value when a know whether this is crazy but any cars heading out yeah I know interesting so even in this case for ages trying to come mixed strategy he could do the best strategy is doing is show one with somebody 7/12 and show to with bloody 5/12 I'm from here even under that scenarios everything although I haven't solved simultaneously at I have a place what is weekly what is people hey Google S new place first migos days gone who's going to start is going to reveal the strategy is strategy the strategy that is going to review is also again I'm going to be probable to show you one I will be 1 - 3 tell you tell you an airplane is trying to maximise and a has to play a pure strategy the best thing I can do is going to be here are we going to be either or deciding which one why doesn't the values you are going to be exactly the same thing as a pie fight minor 7th what's happening here day is fine s what I like to do is a likes to maximize it's been 5 p - 3 - 70 + 4 what would a wax to do who's going to be going first but then he has to minimise dad and P2P exactly the same to mine but now I'm picking the maximum of them the maximum and exactly the same point as before Dublin exactly the same languedoc roussillon Valley also equal to when is my alarm the weather you're playing a mixed strategy you know if you're really your best make strategy at the beach doesn't matter actually the more I gain when you're replying if you were playing it makes me and you would tell your opponent this is the thing I'm going to do the next actually like anything was like you didn't know it or not I still get the same darling can you get 3 - 3 and - 7 p + 4 and then now you're minimising or maximum is to wife national who's to wind end up being at the same time that kind of magic this is called the wine I'm in serum before thing that you just said there's a film about it it says for every simultaneous two-player zero sum game finite number of actions order of fights tonight viewpoint the values are going to the same thing for minimising or a maximum or minimum value sign of the third thing Adidas why Neumann's says if I am reading play play doesn't matter remember if you play me strategy your opponent is going to play for us register birth if you play mixed strategy your opponent is going too far I don't want so in this case the thing is this to end up being equal to the waiter doesn't doesn't matter because the way for you to maximize going to be the point for the two branches Croydon 7/2 I'm not the reason that it is you're trying to minimise the thing that this guy is trying to maximum trying to pick a PC that actually make this thing equal no matter what your opponent you're gonna like it the best thing I'm still have a choice my choices the biggest I want to be that I'm not going to like that what time should I take it should be paid at Next Wikipedia make this one higher than this one of the second player is going to make metaphor the best thing I can do here is make this too I think then the second player whatever they choose one or two stationery near thing when you're too I got to be signing a p it's not going to be too bad for me what I would pick a p that doesn't make me think employers are Forest going to make me when he's going to work best thing I can do is I can make both of them that kind of so the idea here is revealing your optimum extracted the group of that interesting if you're interested with the notes you can use linear programming here intuition behind it is if you're playing mixed strategy the next person has superior strategy and you have and possible options for that that creates and constraints that you're putting in her position and I know you can use lyclear programming using sunrise warrior parking can you talk about this time or seniors games and and you talk about the sitting room we have pure strategies and we saw that if you're a strategy going second is better better if you're just telling you I know if you're using mixed read another turned out it doesn't matter if you're going first or second you're telling them with your best strategy Wonder Woman the next 10 minutes I want to spend a bit of time talking about 9 safari attack about zero sum game where is cider minimax I get some reward to get the negative of that or white versa these are the things called collaborative games where we are disposed maximizing something 1 Netsky like a single optimisation and it's a single maximization in real life York and will example I want to be a prisoner the prisoner's dilemma is a prosecutor who asked a and b individually they will testify against each other frozen testified in both of them are sentenced to 5 years in jail it was of the refuse and sentenced to one year in jail one testifies then he or she get out for free and the other one gets 10-years real quick to pay off matrix I think you kind of have an audio now of how the game works so you had two players A or B which one of you have an option if I review you can testify refuse to buy and pay off Matrix what is that because you have a non-zero sum what's the news Radio 1 on YouTube if I was tested by the other one refuses also refused to testify then I get 10 years get here now going to be for every boy you're going to have a payoff matrix oh so now we have this is the value of the policy and policy will be the utility for 144 player the one who doesn't know your pie here because you don't have the zero sum game when you actually get something and whatever do we care and that's the idea of Nashik inertia calibrium instead of horses pi-star and Firestar be so that no player has an incentive to change their strap so what does that mean so what that means wicked the value function from prospector a value function from first video player tinashe calibrium story and history going to be greater than or equal to value any other policy by a at the same time the same thing is true for Valley open agents be really old is going to be greater than the report or value and any other pipe y6 what does I mean in the sea so what I start from here I start from 1/4 - 10 can I get this I start from here can I can I get this better start from this cell you get 0 pretty girl you get 10 years of age has an incentive to change that he has an incentive here what if you start here play has one your child has one or two just now and get new yourself Garden Centre BMW Bristol you don't have any sense so we have one Nash equilibrium here is motorway sarcastic a motorway because there is like a socially better choice to have YouTube my new Adele but that's not alright so there is a theorem which is an existence theorem between any finite for your game with finite number of actions if you have any pineapple your day don't exist at least one National this is usually one mixed strategy Nash at least one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in this strategy what weight in general direction at least one no answer nothing gamora equilibrium for that we just actually soft that using the minimax 10-minutes playing strategy of 7/4 you might see my current Wi-Fi or two bigger more game and make a collaborative so in a collaborative setting with that means we both get to we both get $4 for reporting collaborative to finger Morocco not a zero-sum game anymore and you have to Nashik Olivia so you would have a setting where AMD both of them and values two or A&E both of them prisoner's dilemma ok so summary so far is simultaneously how to write this one minimax theorem minimax strategies in the single game now in the case of non zero sum game we would have something that slowly retailers Nash's existence theorem still have more this was just a brief like short introduction to game theory and the huge lizard or around different types of games in game theory economics if you're interested in there weather yeah your other types of games like security games or resource allocation games and some characteristics that are similar to think you're interested in any of them maybe you can take it down with you over Project text sign
