the highwomen so our plan for today to continue with talking about search so so what you're going to start doing finish off some of the stuff we start a talking about last time and then after that switch to some of the more interesting topics like living in so few announcements to the solutions to the old exams are on my now so if you guys want to start studying for the exam you can do that to start looking at this problem that would be actually let me start the search to lecture because I think that would be review of some of the topics we've talked about so it might be easy connected to the network so we're not going to do the questions or show the video connect to network alright so so star continue talking about search so if you guys to remember we had this the citibike problem so was go back to that problem I was just try to do a review some of the some of the search search algorithm see talking about last time so suppose you want to travel from CV12 city and only going forward and then from city and you want to go backwards so I'm back to city one going only back play so you so the problem statement is kind of like this starting in city one you're going you're going forward and you're getting to some city and tell me by doing this and then after that you want to go backwards and get to get to City so that's the girl and then the cost of going from any cdi2 silly J is equal to c i so the question is one which one of these following algorithms could you use to solve this problem and it could be more sport so so we have their first breakfast dynamic programming and uniform Costa news really Alberton to talk about last night so maybe just talk to your neighbours for a minute and then we can do both Spotify so let's start talking about this so how about depth first search how many more saying we can use them how many people are saying we can't hear you like good split so that other people think we can't use it for search for some reason you're basically going from city 12C then each one of these edges has a cost of cij I'm just saying cij is greater than or equal to 0 I'm saying about tij but if you remember the first search really wanted to cost to just vehicle 20 because if you remember that holds three like the whole point of depth first search with I could just stop when I try to find a solution and we were swimming that the cost of all the ideas is just so so we can really use this search year because because our course is not Siri so assuming that reasoning how about Brett research can be used for research how long left stop suggesting is can we think about the problem as going from city 12cn and then after that like introduce like your home your problem that continuous dad and start from city and go to ct18 back to that point so I can a second because like you could potentially think that might be an interesting way of thinking about it but with respective of that I can't use deathsaurus I'm so far I'm just talking about this research we spoke about how I'm looking at the problem because they're going to be nonzero so because the cost of 0 can't use this so so lit up my day Howard research can I use for research so we can argue spreader research here because if you remember you really wanted all the cost to be the same didn't need to be zero they needed to me the same thing because then you could just go over the lever and I'm not like I'm not saying I'm not bringing any restrictions and cij being the same so now what's the weather in our programming how are dynamic programming can be used in programming right so that looks right like you could use that have a programming here everything works ok see you later positive looks fine how about actually one question so so don't have to cycle so can I have like a cycle boss battle snake going from 1 to Ireland we could actually use dynamic programming here even if it kind of looks like we have a psycho and the reasons we cannot use the strip weekend basically Drogheda salad again I'm going forward basically go all the way here and then after that for going backwards I have included the directionality to so I'm doing it I'm extending the Stay fitspace to not just be the Siri but be the city in addition to that with the direction that you're going so if I'm in city for you it's 34 going forward and if I some point in the future I'm in city and on again it's City for going backwards so I'll keep track of both the city and the directionality and when I do that then I'm kind of breaking the Cycle but I'm not putting any Cycles here and I can actually use dynamic and then uniform cost search that Dad also sounds good to search it doesn't matter if you have psychosis and if you have positive positive not negative so we could use anyone alright so this was just a quick review of some of the things we talked about last time and another thing we talked about last time was this notion of ok so so we started talking about 3 search algorithms and at some point research to Diana programming and uniform cost search where we are you don't need to like we don't need to add this exponential and the reason behind that was your rehab my patient and in addition to that we had this notion of what is a state of state of a summary of all past actions that are sufficient for us to choose the future so we need to be really careful about choosing a in this previous question we will get past actions so if you would like or cities that you've over 10 being City won the 345 3 again so in terms of state the things that you want to keep track of as what city you are in but in addition to that you want have the directionality because you need to know like where you are how you're getting so I need a couple weeks examples around dad trying to figure out what is what is like a specific notion of state for various problem alright so so it's early last time talking about search problems and any stuff for my thing is so if you remember our paradigm of modelling and inference and learning we started kind of modelling search problems using this form of them where will you find a Starting state that a star and then we talked about the actions of us which is the function over state returns all possible actions and then we talked about the cost function so the class one shantae state an action and tell us what is the cost of that that that that and then you talk about the successor function which takes the state in action and tells us where we end up and again we had the end function that was just checking if you're in an engine these are all the things that we needed to define a search for any kind of tried and a couple weeks a the trial example the city example and then after talking about these different ways of thinking about search problems we started talking about various types of inference algorithm so we talk about research so that her search with research that their search for iterative deepening backtracking search and then after that I can talk to myself face craftascope algorithms like uniform cost search and don't have a programmer so last time we an example of uniform cost search but we didn't get to prove the correctness of it so I want to switch to some of the last last last time slow just go over the stairs quick theorem and then after that just switched back uniform cost search like if you remember what we doing it from Costa we had three different sets we had an exported which was basically the set of states that we have visited and we are sure how to get to them and we nearly optimal path and we know everything about Cadiz France which was a set of states that we have got to them but you're not sure if the cost that we have is the best there might be a better way of getting to them and you're not like me you're not sure and then you had it on exports set of states which are basically states that we haven't seen so we did this example we started with all the states in an exported and removed them to the frontier and then from the frontier to export said so this was example that we did and then we realised like even if you have Cycles we can actually do this algorithm and then we ended up finding the best task being from A2 B2 C2 d and ad cost so what actually implement uniform cost search so I think we'll do this last time so going back to set of so so we started writing up his hours and search problems so we have they've written dynamic programming already in backtracking search so now we can we can try to implement uniform cost for doing so we need to have this priority queue data structure so this is in a YouTube while I'm just showing you what it looks like functions and has it has an update function and it has a removed mean so it's just a data structure that I'm going to use for my front here because I'm popping up things up my ears I'm going to use the status tray so let's go back to uniform cost search so we're going to find us frontier where we are adding state two tremarnock sportset you're adding States to the and it's going to be a priority queue so so we have that data structure cos I'm just important YouTube and you're going to basically add the start state would it cost of 0 to the frontier so that's the first and then after that like wild the frontier is not empty so whilst true what we're going to do is we're going to remove the minimum path element from the front so basically just pop off the printer you're the best thing that exists and just move that to the export cancel half the thing from the front you basically I get this past cost and I get the so if you're in an estate then you're just going to return at Ascot with the history and not putting a history here for now I'm just returning the cost after popping off Estate from the frontier the thing we were doing with the children of that so the way we do that is were going to use the successor and cost wondering that we define last time so we can basically iterate over action you stayed and costs in the successor and cost function and and basically update our frontier by adding these new States and the cost of you're going to add is cost bus pass cost if that is dead so that's what the update function doesn't that's pretty much it like that is uniform Costa you add stuff to the frontier new pop-up stuff from and that way you explain me move things from the unexplored set to the exports the latest looks like it is doing the right thing so it's got the same value as dynamic programming so looks so this code is also online so if you want take a look at it ok so that was the result of the pseudocode of uniform ok stop we hope the funeral turn the Unicorn advert set a bit by 6 questions what's the runtime of uniform so the run time of uniform car service order of and login where the Viking is because of the bookkeeping of the priority queue and you're going over all the edges so so he can think of I'm here as the edges and worst case scenario if you have a fully connected graph it's technically and squirt like in practice we have spotted RAF so people and is the number of states that you have explored and not all this Estates and dynamic programming is order of so technically programming display the only difference between lessons beginning was a difference between this and a doctorate the only difference is this is trying to solve a search problem so you're not like it's pouring all this state when you get to the solution you get the solution and then you just returned dijkstra you're going from your basically swearing all of all of the Stainton alright I just want to quickly talk about this correctness theorem so so for you from carstairs to actually have a correctness theorem which basically says uniform cost does the right thing so basically this is if you have a state that you're popping off the front here and you're moving it from the frontier to explore then it's priority about value which is equal to pass cost of us is actually the minimum cost of get sisters so what this is saying is this is my exported said so this is my Sport and then there is my Frontier and I have a start state and then I have some sweet dead right now I have decided that I am popping off us from the front here to explore because that is the best thing that has the best pass cost so what the film says is the staff that I have from a start to s is the shortest time possible to get to get to the state so the way to prove that is to show that the cost of this path is lord and any other pass Dad go from Earth start so let's say there is some other past the screen why that goes from sfr to us some other way and the way that it goes to us is he probably leave the exports set of states from some stage hot to some ghost go to some other so you and inform you you understand the point is if I had it on a path that goes it needs to leave that export set from Sam's so what I want to show is I want to show that the cost of the green line that is greater than the cost of the black the cast of the green light what is the cost of the it's going to be there to hear and then cost of treating you and the cost of you to s so I can say will this course is actually greater than or equal to our priority of tea because that is the cost of 40 Plus cast of 22 news I'm just dropping this last part for you to ask him to drop the cast of green is like in Laceby CO2 priority of tea Plus cost of tea what is Article 2 priority is just a number that just a number that you are getting off the priority queue so that is actually you go to past cost of pause cast of tea2you and in this value is going to actually be greater than or equal to priority audio why is that because if unit is in my front here I visited you so I really have some priority value for you and and the value that I was signed for the priority of you is either equal to this pass cost of 2 plus cost of 22 you using my explored using my Frontier or it is something better that I don't know what it is surprise me of you is going to be less than or equal to this pass cost of 2 + and for what do I know in terms of priority of you and priority of s I know priority of you is going to be greater than O2 priority why is that because I already know I'm popping up esnext and not talking of you like I know I'm popping off the thing that has the least amount of priority value here and and Lettuce an animal that is equal to cost of the Black Lion that was just a quick ecru fob white can you phone calls search always reach best minimum cost alright let's go to the slides again so just a comparison quick comparison between dynamic programming and uniform cost so we talked about dynamic programming we know doesn't allow cycles with in terms of action cars that can be anything like it work you can have negative and in terms of complexity order of and then uniform class search you can have Cycles so that is cool but the problem is the cost me to be knackered and into order event log and if you have if you're having a situation where you have Cycles and your costs are actually negative there to sort her out with and cold bellman-ford we are not talking about in this class but you could actually like have a different order ascending alright ok so that was that was beside me up in France right now we have what a good series or ways of going about doing in French for search Spotify for my life then and now the plan for this work sure is to think about the learning so how are we going to go back to learning when you have such problems and when are search problem is not fully specified and there are things in the search problem that are not specified anyone wearing what they are like so so that's going to be the first one of the lottery and then towards the end of the lecture we're going to talk about if you are always seems that makes things faster so so smarter ways of making things faster store and some sort of relaxation alright so so what school bags are transportation this was transportation problem where are we had a start stayed and we can either walk and by what time we can go from state to stay spice one and dad costs one or we can take a tram and magic tram that takes us from status 2020 and dad cost can anyone get so we can follow fellow search problem we can like you said this last time we can actually try to find what is the best pass to get from state 1 to any state and like the password walked walked put the singers on the rollers are perfect right like modelling is actually really hard like it's not that we always have this nice one or with everything and you could end up in scenarios where we have a search problem and you don't actually know what the costs are actions are so we don't actually know what the cost of walking is over the cost of tram but maybe we actually have access to to this optimal paths like maybe I know the optimal pass is wok.wok tram tram tram walk tram tram but I don't know what the cost turn the point of learning is to go bad learning what is Costel used are based on these optimal path that so I want actually you there decosta walking is 1 and the cost of trauma a common problem that we have machine learning in general so for example you might have data from a how a person does something personal and I have no idea what was the cost of the person was not my thing to grasp objects but I have with the projector you I know what the past they took and it picks up and what I can do if I have access to that class of how to fix up an artic then from that I can actually learn what was the cost function that there are optimising because then I can put that past 110 may be on a robot does what solution in this case DB questions the question is it possible to have multiple Solutions can actually see that like later like what sort of a solution Derby going to get a solution the ratio of it is the thing at nada so if you have what is 1 - 4 figure 28 you could have had the same sort of behaviour and it also depends on what sort of day do you have like if your data allows you to actually recover that the truth The Raven actually Pop Idol alright ok so if you think about it the search problem you're trying to solve this was inference problem was when we're given cannabis search formulation and you're given a cost and then I'll go with to find a sequence of actions is optimal sequence of actions that was the tallest path or the best path in and some listen the forest search is this forward problem with your dinner cost and you want to find a sequence interesting isn't learning in some sense is an inverse problem it's the inverse of absurd so the inverse of search is if you give me that sequence of actions that the best sequence of actions that you've got them can you figure out what the costs so so in something to think of learning as this inverse problem of search and we are going to have your address so I'm going to go over one example to talk about learning and I'm actually going to use the notation of the machine learning lecture said we had at the beginning of last week basically so we have that's already have a search problem without costs and data input sofas also we're kind of framing this problem of learning as a prediction problem and if you remember prediction problems in prediction problems we had an input so our input was x and this case you're saying airport is a search problem search problem without so that is my in and then we have are squids and in this case my Atwood why is this Artemis sequence of actions that one get SO2 solution and what I want to do is I want a quick if you remember machine learning the idea was I would want to find this predictive this f function if that we taking input f of x and then it would basically return the solution pass in in other settings so that was kind of your idea that the Explorer machine learning so what started I'm going to do that so that started an example of area in City 1 and then maybe we walk to City 2 you can walk to City 2 hello from the movie I have two options I can keep walking to get to CV4 so I can do walk walk walk or maybe I can take the tram and end up in city the thing is I don't actually know what the cost of these I don't know what the cost of workers where the cast of one thing I know is that my mysolution pass my wife is equal to walk Spa so so what way to go bad this it's actually start with some initialization of discuss the weather to finding these costs or going to be I'm going to use the word I'm going to write here maybe straight up here I'm going to use w like because I want use the same mutation as the learning witches so we is going to be the rate which one of my actions I have to Action I don't work I can take the tram so I'm going to call them action WF Action one is w of watching and then we of action to is WR taking the chance to Action 2 is taking the tram time defining these we value defining this week's is just as a function of actions this could technically if I stayed in actions but right now I'm just simplifying this and I'm saying the w siz values the cost of walking just depends did the cost of going from 1 to 2 just depends on my action it doesn't depend on what state imagine settings work it actually depends on my quad City you so then under that scenario what is the cost of cost of y it is going to be ww4 still your work so what I'm suggesting is what's a start with something which starts with assistant I'm going to say walking and it's always going to cost 3 again the reason it's always going to cost 3 as I'm basically saying my weight only depend on the action so it's always going to cost I'm going to say why not was to say the tram takes the cost of so this doesn't like right but like I said this is the rights cancel now would I want to do is I want to be able to update these weights update these values in a way that I can get this optimal path they have to walk how can I get started with this random in associations or what nana have done that I can I can try to figure out what is the Optima based on use wait so what is my prediction so that is why prime that is my prediction based on his weight celeb just said what is that is what cos this 5 reviews waiters random wait for that just come up I'm going to pick my contract and that is my prediction so now we want to do if you want to update our w's based on the fact that our true label is Wok and a prediction the algorithm that kind of does this is just like the most link thing possible so so what it does it's going to first look at the truth value it's going to the cats also the weights or starting from so I decided that the skies 3 and I decided that I'm going to update so I'm going on every action in this and for every action in this path I'm going to down weight that the weight why am I going to bed because I don't want to pay no I said this is the true thing I wanted to wait of the two things to be small so icy walk and my ok see you the waiter that was 3 I'm going to down with that by 1 I'm going to I see work again I'm going to bring down one I see what again I'm going to subtract one again no I'm going to go over my prediction and for every action I see you I'm going to bring it up bring the cost to wait up by 1 Sophie work again here I'm going to bring it up turn off the desk surprise surprise bring it up by one because it's over my wife and I feed tram and then because I see tram I'm going to bring this up by 1 and Dad somine you wait here are going to B3 the day the weight of just became one and in the tram just became and now I can kind of repeat doing this and see if that gets me this afternoon I'm going to try it running with them if I run my shower them this class and this path cost for this 3:30 so I'm actually going to get this and this back so my new prediction is just going to be there going to be the same thing my way so not going to so I'm talking about the various simplified version of this but there's always one so the very simplified version of this is a spiritual about saying that we just depend on on if you make the weight depend on state in actions there is a more generalized form of this this is called the structure and we'll talk about briefly talk about the diversion for this case were just that you're literally just bye-bye whatever whatever you're doing it up here you better bring it down by the same thing Python wireless a rose why we do the plus one after do you have a minus one so what am I doing the minus one that's so but I weekend why here right like this is the thing that I really want it so if I so when I see work I realise that working with a good thing so I need to bring down the weight what if the waves are already had like new dad walking is pretty good then like the way that already had knew that watching is pretty good I should I cancel that so that's why you're doing the posh one because I got this stage like I know working is pretty good up here like my prediction also said what so if I'm writing it I should add it to I don't like it then cancel that but like right here like I don't know why can is good so I'm going to bring down the weight of Dad and then bring up the weight off tram bed frame with the tram is the way to go so to avoid dad next time around I'm going to make the cost of tram higher so I don't Take That the only resource I'd like atoms as different from what yes so if so you're asking this if my Wi-Fi and white from Primark on with the same thing walk or something and at the very end this last one to be different Justin for that last one you're deciding one right so so it does like it does actually address that and it just run it until you get this sequence has to be exactly the same thing to don't have any does a metaphor Newcastle become biggest does it matter if I knew cost because what sort of search algorithm you're using at the end of the day with spine of using a programming so I can have a look in a bit of cost and I'm just going with programming at the end of the day with that to find it happy just like this result we got here 1 and 3 is actually write like it if you remember like when we find the tram problem we said walking cost one and tram cost to but you never got that the reason I never got that is the solution were going to get here is just based on at training day so it might just work work work this is like the best thing I can get that kind of like convert to the solution where where do to end up being equaliser I have a mistake if I have more I'm going to do this longer and actually tried out another training data and then I might convert porcelain Spanish riding lights frozen from the apple tree ok so the question is how to reinitialise so I think it's actually not that bad you just basically have the sequence and for the more general case your computer a future value that you just computer false and you just do one thing or subtraction so there's no Dad cost indeed 4 + 2 giving up our cars for people time is interesting so in this current format so if you have some prior algorithm maybe I done that your prediction is going to be better right or if you have some nice about it maybe you'll get a better prediction and then based on that you don't updated as much so maybe we can incorporate in the search problem again this is the most general form of this algorithm what kind of work and simplified version of it also like not doing anything fancy doing something worried about overfeeding at all yes it's time to show some examples and overfitting so I get back alright so ok so this is just like a think that run the slide or whatever already took him so yes so here is example so we start with 34 walk into for tram and then the ideas I can we going to change the car so we get the dissolution that you were hoping for and another was saying we can assume that the costs only depend on your actions I'm assuming cost of any is just w army in the most general form it can depend on on the States ok so then if you take any candidate out with then what would be the cost of the past it would just be the sum of these w values over over all the edges so we just be WV1 possible your way to WA3 and have you seen in the 60 and the cost of a path is just double your work wys double lights off so that's how we computer alright so so now I was actually weak at this like running in practice you started insulating WC2B and then after that you're going to hear it for some amount of tea and then we have a training set of examples in might not be just one here I just wrote this is one example like the only training example I had was with that walk walk walk is it but I can't you can imagine having multiple training examples for research problem and then what you can do as you can computer or prediction so that is why prime given that you have some w and then you can start with this w CT20 and then just computer prediction why Prime and then basically you can do this person by this type of action so for each action that is in your true why that is in your true label you're going to subtract 1 so to decrease the cost of true y and then for each action that is in your prediction you're going to add 1 to 20 alright so so what's the implementing I was trying to get some examples let's go back to the Tram problem to this is again the same time problem you just use the same sort of I actually went back and wrote up the history here if you remember last time I was saying I'm not returning the history now we have a way of returning history by U2 one of these algorithms because you're going to call dynamic programming and we need the history alright so let's go back to our transportation problem so we had a cast of one and two for walking and tram what we want to do is we want to put Predators there so when actually put this way I'm eating give that to our transportation problem so in addition to the number of Fox now I'm going to actually give like the weight of different acts Kim alright so then walking has and tram house so now I have updated my transportation problem to generate a different rate values so now we want to be able to generate some some training example so that's what I want to do I want to generate different types of training examples that we can call so we can get this through labour so what's the song that the true weights for our training examples just one that is one me really and then you're going to just write this prediction function that we can call up later to do to get different values of y the prediction function is going to get the number of box so so it's going to go the number facts here and it is going to out with this path that we want so it's got this y-values so alright so the whole point of prediction is basically make running SFX function and we can define our transportation problem with with and n wait and the way you're going to get this is bike on dynamic programming someone asked you earlier I could because to be negative yes because now I'm calling dynamic programming and if it's problem has negative cost that is fine too so and a history is going to get and action you stayed and and cost right so with the finger they actually want to return from my predict function as a sequence of actions so I'll just get the action out of this history that I get from then I'm calling my programming I'm my problem dad is going to return a history I'll get the sequence of actions from that and that is my prayer I can just call that so let's go back to generating example so so I'm just going to go for a try out in the end to go from 1 to 10 so one to ten and you're calling the predict function on these true weights to get the true wireless so these are my true weight some samples or just coin generator examples here Oasis printer examples see how it looks like we haven't done anything like in terms of just like creating these training examples by calling this predict function undyne the true rate I have a type of here generate examples fix the typo ok so that kind of Us right that's my training is 19 and then what is what is the path that you would want to if you had this true weights the one so now I'm not waiting so I'm ready to write this structure for set it gets me examples of training examples of these paths and then we're going to it for some Range and then mcken basically go over all the examples that we have in our through y values and then we can we can basically go and update our way to space start Maidstone dad and based on that so listen initialise the weights to just been 0 so that's for walking in tram there 20 and prediction actions this is when recalling predict free standard the current wait so is my current weight or 0 then Productions is just add Wi-Fi Productions is my prime 2 actions why like the things that we had on the slide if my mistakes I'm making too so if it or not equal to each other and then I'm going to just keep a counter for number of mistakes if the two Become you call them then my number mistakes is zero I'm going to break down maybe I'm happy then ok so I make a prediction and then after that I'm going to update the weight value so hurry up basically subtract if your interactions which is why the labels that have created from my training example and then do pass one if you're in prediction actions based on the current weight value pretty much it like that is structured sprintf nicely so I can iteration and number of mistakes we have and what is actually that way to values that I'm just breaking this whenever I have by Kanye 60th number of my 60 sounds good so if number of mistakes is zero then I'll ok so all good I'm going to run this it's not going to do anything as I didn't call so I'll go back in actually call I have another type of here this is going to get an era accorded with knotweed fix add yet so I was actually looking so what we got is the first iteration number for 6 with 6 and then we ended up actually the first person to reach and we ended up converting 21 the second generation the number of mistakes just became 0 and then we just got 12 weighted hula hoop looks ok to me that's my training later everything was fine eDreams give me the number of the number of location but the number you would still so see what you're asking no you should like you should figure it for your that so we can go over an example after after the class and I'll show you alright so ok so what's 5 1 and 3 so with 1 and 3 takes a little bit longer and but it does recover SO14 is actually interesting one because it does recover something it does recover 28 doesn't recover one in four will I give him my data actually 28is is there is no reason for me to get 11 and 4 like in the ratio of them is the thing that they actually care about you then if I get 2 and 8 like that is a reasonable set of weights that one could get I'm going to try a couple more things 1 and 5 I'm gonna try one in five and this is what I get so I get the way to walk to be - 1 and Afraid of trying to meet one what was stake is 0 the wisest having so what's happening here is if you working my training it up here my training leader is just has like what what it hasn't seen tram ever so has no idea like with the cost of trainers with respect to the cost of an alarm that so we're going to fix that like one way to fix that is to go in the training data actually like getting ready that's we can kind of do that so like just one thing to remember is this is just going to fit your training later whatever it is so yeah so any fixed bed then walk becomes two and try and becomes tonight which is not 1 and 5 would it is getting there like it's a bit of ratio and number of a 6 is still 0-0 on what you're looking for like if you're trying to like that and not your number of mistakes is 0 and you're happy with this you can just go with and even though I like Catherine like actually recovered the exact that the ratio that's fine maybe you're looking for the jacket she wasn't should like run it longer Stratford perceptron like suspect again dad is a good question so in can you sit in an hour period reasons for Attitude doing this the more general form of it it's commonly used in like licking matching likes words and sentences I have an experienced Ida but I can look into it just being the optimal cast yes Match Attax if you're feeling it all the other it's just matching hat you're saying is yeah so so interns ok so you're saying terms of Life bringing down the number of mistakes then then it should always mate but if you have some true like weights that you're looking for and it's not represented in your data said then it's not necessarily Windows settings I could find another version of this is when you're doing what the word learn and then you actually have a true love or do you want to find I can do something you can tell you falling to buy cokollata markers you want to find out whether it works you're right like if you're just mate the data the scaling would be a different problem right so than stealing is kind of shaping so can have different versions of the reverse function and if you get any of them that is fine but but you might still I get into local optimal that's not explained by the way this things are fine rewind more stuff it's actually going to skip these this is a more general form of its remember I was saying this we as a function of a butt you could you could have a more general form where your cost function is not just we are the functions of a it is actually w set a future and then the cost of a pass is w x a features of a and that's just the summer features over the edge so we can have this more general form over this life later on maybe next but just real quick to update here is is this more general form update which is update your w based on subtracting the features over your true path puts the future's over your set up more time off for months cars algorithm so my Collins was working on this in in natural language processing he was actually interested in it in the setting of part-of-speech tagging so so you might have one sentence and you want to tag each one of the each one of the labels here as a noun or a verb or determiner or now and again so so he was think he was basically looking at this problem I search problem and he was using like him what type of algorithms to try to figure out like what what one of these part of speech tags to the sentence so he has some scores and then based on the scores and his status it goes like up and down you move the scores up and down which uses the same can use the same ID again in machine translation so you can have what have you heard about me you can have multiple types like a bunch of translations of some fries and then you can operate and download them based on your training day alright ok so now it's moved to a ice AA a star now alright so you're right so we've talked about search problems in general doing in France and then doing learning on top of them and then now I want to talk a bit about making things faster using smarter ideas in Spotify what is the last Frontier industry in this is this is a prediction problem right so so in that prediction problem we are trying to basically figure out with WWE star as closely as possible as we are matching this wwy trying to so basically like the way you're solving this is not necessarily as an optimisation problem they were solving it what is my just like to eat to try to match my wife ok so let's get started so I don't have internet so I can show you but I think the link for the astute work when you go to there to the file so ideas if you go back to uniform cost search like an uniform costs what we wanted to do was you want to get from the point to some solution for every word uniformly like increase explore the state around until we get the song final you're a star is to basically do uniform cost search but do it a little bit smarter and moved towards the direction of the I had a ghost particularly like in a corner maybe I can I can move in that directions to Mordor so here is like an example of that Victoria's so I can start from a start and if I'm using uniform concert again I'm uniformly kind of exploring all the states possible until I hit my and then I'm happy I'm done I've sort myself out the thing is I've done all these wasted effort and this side so uniform cost search in Athens has problem of the sixth wearing a bunch of states for no good and what we want to do is we want to take into account Stead we're just going from a star to us and so we don't really like need to do all of that we can actually just try to get to the get to so going back to me so on going back to her research problems work the start from the start and then get to some state and then we have this and what uniform cost search does is it basically orders Estates based on past cost of and then export everything around it discuss the weather Premier Inn Staines there is also this thing called Future Past and when I'm on stage I don't want export other things at this side I actually wanted to move in the direction of kind of reducing my my future cost and get it to my to my the cost of me getting from estar 2sn it's really just like past cost of s boss Hugo Boss can you find me what future cost of Direction future cost call the poem was saw solving a problem I don't have access to future future but I do have access to something like I can potentially have access to something else I'm gonna call you 80s and that is an estimate of future so I'm going to add a function called HMS and this is called a heuristic and and a seriously good estimate what Future car if I have access to this maybe I can update my car to be something as what has Costas in addition to that like I can add this heuristic and dad helps me to be a little bit smarter than running my hours the ideas ideal you were going I would want to do is I went exploring the order of pass cost prosecutor I don't have you had your course I had the answer to my search instead Stardust as it explores in the order of past cost Plus remember uniform Casta exposed just in the order of turn uniform cost like we don't have that an database is a heuristic it's an estimate of the so what does a starred with actually do something right so so as they are basically just does uniform so Oliver is uniform plaster with a new cast so before I had this blue cast cast of sna this was my course before now I'm going to update my car give me the Prime of sna which is discussed the rustic over the successor as in a minus the here so so that is the new car stand and I can just run uniform cost search on this new car so so I'm going to call it pause time sna car service Andover to search pause heuristic over successor of sna - euro 6 over why do I want this what this is saying is if I'm in Southside s ok and there is somewhere to stay successor SMS so I can take in Action a and end up in successor and there is some SNP here that I'm really trying to get to oh was my estimate of future car was this a saying is my estimate of future cost forgetting from successor to sn minor my estimate of getting from a future cost of STIs and should be the thing on adding to my car what does reinforcing is it basically makes me move in the direction because it because if I end up in some other state that is not in the direction of us and then that it's going to be really bad that you were going in the direction I'm going to put more costs on Dad so never going there if you're going to die let's go to go another all depends on what your age function is and how good like overnight one can you have and how you're designing your you're here is 6 but that's kind of the idea behind it so here is an example actually so that we have this example we have a b c d and E and you have cost of one and all these edges and will be want to do if you want to go from sea to eat that if I'm running uniform cost search for what would I do I'm at Sea I'm going to explore bmd they had a cost of one and then after that I'm going to explore A&E and then finally I get to get why do they spend all of their time we can get A&E I shouldn't have done that or not in the direction of getting instead of where I can do it is if someone comes and tells me what I had a futuristic function can be evaluated on your state and if you receive function is going to give you for 3 to 1 and 0 for each one of these when you can update your cast and maybe you had a better way of getting this is actually perfect because it's actually the future point of the heuristic is to get as close as possible to the Future cost to future cars with this heuristic was going to happen as my new cast is going to how's it going to change it's going to become because them what about the cost of the edge was before which was 1 each of the case of free sample cost of going from seat if you would taxi to be it's the Old cast which one pot here is a cat B which is 3 - eristic see which is 2 that ends up giving me 1 + 3 - 2 that is equal to 2 someone looking computer like I like new car still use the cloud and then dad has a cost of 2 for a boy in this direction and cost of 0 for going towards and if I just rung you from concert again here then I can get to this opportunity set a reminder Daystar result in really that's ok so so so so the question is is a Starlight causing my greedy approaches so no actually we're going to talk about that all that you received your shooting coronavirus if you're choosing a star is actually going to be returning the optimal value but does depend on the a60 it actually looks like sex if you choose a good Hero what are white spots why is cost of ccy because let's work with starling so this is like the grass that I started with so I started with the cost like the blue cats being all one but now I'm saying those costs are not good I'm going to update them based on the series 6 so I can get closer to the goal ask voice to get off Edwin what cast are you going to return and you don't want to return the actual cost return the actual cost but you can run you're out with them with the scariest thing added in because that allows you to explore less things and it's been more alright so good questions to ask as well what is the Furious had a serious it look like I can any does any hero 6 like work lol turns out that not Every Hero Stick work so here is an example so get the blue things or the car that already given these are the things that I already have and I can just run my search other than the red things are the values of the heroes someone gave them to me for now in general would one of the sign then someone comes in and gives me this year if I use and then what I want to do is I want to compute the new cost so the questions is a seriously good I did my new car still use they work like this this work we'll have I'm going to it's not going to work not going to work it will be just got a negative right so I'm running at the end of the day like a star is just uniform cost and I can have pictures so I'm not like I was just not able to have here so quickly to have specific properties and Andrew should think about those properties are one property that you would want to have the heuristics to have a society of consistency the most important property so so we talked about heuristics I'm going to start my properties of them here they should be consistent so consistent here is the first condition is it's going to satisfy the triangle inequality and what that means is like a constant you're the updated cost that you have should be should be not so do this cost Primark is there a this should be that means that the Old Custom pause HR and successor and the News destroying for that - HMS is great that is the first condition and then the second condition that you were going to put is that future cost of an ascent is going to be a cautious hero in future cost of the end stage should be zero so then the futuristic the intestate is also equal to have the property that we would want to have if you want to talk about consist what natural things that you wouldn't want to have right the first one is basically saying for the course you're going to end up add should be should be great and you can run uniform cos they're trying it but it's really like talking about this triangle inequality that you want to write like it's kind of an estimate of the Future car so if I'm going to from Earth taking action with that cost of SMA dad added up should be graded set the estimate of so that's all you're saying and then the last one also make sense right like I do want to future Castle zero right so then he rhystic at ascent should also be because I get heuristic is just an estimate of the so what do I know about a star beyond that one thing that we know if that if he is consistent if I have this consistency property then I know that I star is correct that says a story is going to be correct this consist you can kind of wicked add through an example so so I say that I am at the cereal and I take A1 and I end up at the Swan and I take it to 2 3 and under my desk I have kind of like a pass that so then if I'm looking at the cost of each one of these right I'm looking Dad cost.of cost Prime I've 80 and A14 what is adequate updated cast old cast which is cost of 0 and pause 1 - who's this 150 that is the cost of going from s0 and taking you one I'm going to just write all the car for the rest of this to figure out with the cost of cast of the Pack is just to some discussed 182 cost of s182 Plus eurosic add 2 - 1 so that is the new cast of this and the new cast of The Last purchase cost Prime of 283 and that is the Old cart stuff is 2 a 3 add 3 - 06 add up all these if I'm talking about the cost of a path discussed Arabic crossword point of things get cancelled at the sky gets cancelled by the sky and what I end up with is some of is Newcastle's cost frames Si is just equal to sum of broadcast of Si -1 AI pause my horrific I just last 8 NCT Maya eristic Iron Man saying my heuristic is a consistent heuristic so what is a property of a consistent heuristic the heuristic value at s end should be equal to 0 this guy is also equal to 0 so what I end up with is if I work at a pass with the new cast the sum of the new cast of the some of the old cast why does Samsung card stand and it's constant is just the heuristic value at SC stop the weather's important because when we talk about the correctness I remember we just proved at the beginning of this lecture that uniform cost search is the cast and is returning is up that is that is disc a star is just uniform cost search with a new car play star is just running on this new this new cast is the same thing that they have is old cost minus a constant so if I'm also waiting the new course is the same thing is optimising the Old Cross so there's going to return the aftermath alright so that is basically saying things on the slide like so that's 1 euro 6 being consistent we've now just talk about a star being correct because it's only it's correct only if they're here only if you had that consistency gets her to get certificate disguise equal to zero and get the fact that you guys are going to be positive and I can run you in front the next property that we have here for a star is a star is actually more efficient than uniform cost because I've already seen this right like the whole point is to not explore everything and exploring a director if you remember uniform cost seriously how does it explorable in explode all the states that have a past cost that are less than day pass cost so remember uniform cost search your exploring with the the order of past cost of and I know it's for all those states that have asked us worse than that a star Like That Stardust is exposed in this so the Explorer states that have a past cost less than pass cost of the instant minus the Hero look at the right side the right side just became become smaller like the right side uniform car service was just passed customers and now there's pass cost of assent -206 I just became smaller and then why do they become smaller because now I'm doing this more directed search and not searching everything uniformly around and that's the whole point of the and that makes it actually more so interpretation of this is if it is larger than that's better I like it with my hair stick is as weird as possible that is better because then I am kind of exploring smaller like area to get to the sun the proof of this is like two lions that's actually show how does looks like so if I'm trying to get from sr2s n again if I'm doing uniform costed I'm uniformly exploring so like all stayed around and that is equivalent to swimming at the hero stick is it called it's basically uniform class searches as star when they hear things so what is the point of the heuristic the plane of the hero stickers to estimate where the future I know what the future cost then each of us is just a quote a future car and then that would be awesome and I only need to explore that green kind of space and then the thing I'm exploring is it's just a note that are on the minimum pass cost and cost and I'm not exploring anything that's the most efficient thing when in practice like I don't have access to future clothes in impressive I had access to feature class that the problem was I have access to some numeracy that is some estimate of the future cos it's not as bad as uniform costed it's getting close to the Future cos like a look about your future or somewhere in-between so it is going to be more efficient than you alright so basically the ID of Esther is it kind of distorted it cost and favorites is and state so I'm going to add here that a star is efficient so that is the other thing call properties one more property about the risks and then after that we can talk about relax a property called admissibility which is something that you've kind of been talking you already been talking about how this should get close if you to cos I should be an estimate of the future stop an admissible heuristic is a heuristic where 8 of us is less than or equal to future and the cool thing is if you already have consistency than you I really have this property then you have admissible another property is admissible which means is less than or equal to future cast of alright so the proofs of the tsar again one-liners so I just want is more than one so you can use induction here to prove to prove that if you have consistently than you're going to have a disability ok so so you've just talk about how your store is the sufficient thing you've talked about harlequin come up with we haven't had to come up with you at 6 with your talk about consistent heuristics that are going to be useful and they're going to give us admissibility and you're going to give us correctness and how like a star is going to be the smallest fish actually have not talked about how to come up with Hero so spending next yeah talking about talking about how to come up with us the main idea here is just relax so so what are so so the way you come up with serious is with pick the problem I just make it I saw that news so Dad is kind of the whole idea remember each of us is it supposed to be close to future and then solve these problems can be really difficult right so there's so if you have a lot of constraints and it becomes harder to solve the problem so if you relax it and we just remove them straight through your sodium much easier problem and that could be used as a heuristic as an Ally of heuristic that estimates were the future so I'm wondering Wilkinson I'm going to remove constraints the cool thing that happens if sometimes we have closed-form Solutions sometimes you just easier search problems that you can solve and sometimes you at work independence our problems and we can find a solution to them and dad gives us a good so that is my go right I would want to let me just go through a couple of weeks or so so what are you have a search problem and I want to get the triangle to get to the circle and that is what I want to do and I have all these was there an address in Israel what is a good Hero I'm going to just relax the problem I'm going to remove what all this was just knocked down the wall and how that that just seems much right now I actually have a closed-form solution for getting a triangle get to the get to the circle I can just computer Manhattan this and I can use that at the Hero it's not going to be there like actually like what future customers what is an approximation for it so usually can think of the heuristics that he's optimistic views of what the future cos it's like it's an optimistic view of the problem what what if there was like no walls but if there no one's here then how would I get from my location to another location the solution to that is going to give you this future cost estimate of future cost value all the time problems and the Tramp would you have a more difficult version of will we have a cancer and it's constraints we can have more transactions now this is my problem I need to solve the same kind of different take me to talk about how to come up with states for his last time and even dad seem difficult like I need to have it location I need to have the difference between a walk and tram that seems kind of difficult like I have an order of Ennis Court States instead of doing Dad just removing straight I'm going to remove the game relaxing and then after relaxing it then I have a much easier search problem I need to deal with I only have this location and then I can just go with that location so so here was like a middle part is if I remove these constraints I'm going to have this easier search problems this relaxation and I can compute the future cost of these relaxation music my favourite techniques like dynamic programming with one thing to notice is I need to compute that 41 through and cos it seriously is the function of state right to actually need to compute future cost for this relax problem for all states from and that allows me to have like a better estimate the Earth Song engineering things that you might need to do that you're so so for example you might say so here we are looking for future past so if you plan to use uniform cost search for whatever reason like a baby don't have it doesn't work in the setting you need to use uniform costed you need to make a few engineering things to make it work if you remember uniform costs search would only work on Past cast as I work on future course so you need to create a reverse problem for you can actually computer future so it's a few engineering thing but beyond that it is basically just running after Tower thermostat we know I'm due through lax and I will give us if you received value and will put down in a problem and you're going solid and another cool thing that you were 6 give us is this idea of having independent so problem so so here is another example I want to solve this this 8-puzzle and move blocks you and then come up with this new configuration that seems hard again a relaxation of that is just a soon at the tiles can over so the words your problem says the tires cannot overlap I'm just going to relax it then you can just go wherever and you can over much simpler and now I have 8 independent problems for getting each one of these points from one location to another location and I have a closed-form solution for that cos that again just Manhattans Dad give me hear a stick that's an estimate that's not perfect it's an s and I can use that estimate in my original search part 12 song it was just some examples of this idea of removing removing and stress and coming up with better here mistakes I like knocking down was like why I can transfer with overlapping pieces pieces and that allows you to kind of salt is no problem and then is your reducing the Verge cast from infinity to some finite finite cost alright so on so I'm going to wrap up your next set a running but I think you guys are so what's happening
