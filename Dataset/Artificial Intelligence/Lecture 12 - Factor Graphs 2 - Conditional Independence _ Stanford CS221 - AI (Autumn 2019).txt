today we're gonna be coming csvs by and possibly just as importantly your all halfway through recorder so Congratulations 6 more weeks to go so keep it up I also happy Halloween hope you all have fun via today without my CSCS so this is continuing these top of that we've been covering since Monday which is about this kind of setting rate so you have variables in this case we have 3 x 1 x 2 and x 3 and each variable represents some kind of discrete object that can take on one of several values and so the set of values that a single variable can take on is called it to domain an just to continue reviewing these variables have factors which are functions that take as arguments one or more variable and the factors this we say ok how much do I like this a sign of my variables so for example Factor to looks at X1 and x2 and it says ok X1 has been assigned some value X2 has been a Samsung value how much do I like that assignment do I really like it if she gives a high value do I not like it if so you 0 that I'm in so importantly and weak all the argument so all the variables that we give to a factor that the scope of that fact and so we had this example that we talked about on Monday and I'm just gonna revisit it so in this case we have variables correspond to people 3 people and and we know that first of all the first two people person 1 person do they have to agree to each other main person to in person to read these sometimes agree with each other but not all the time an and so first we say is with her first Factor we said that person one is definitely blue so we see the Seer by saying needs the values that the variable can take on red or blue and this is how much we like that darling this track first factory saying is that it doesn't like redhall 20 and it like two little one and then we have the second Factor this includes the fact that they must agree and relax saying is that every time but the first I'm very bored is excellent and the second variable which is x everytime they agree they are both ride a bus blue we give it away otherwise we give it 0 I know we have this back there which says that they tend to agree in when coding app by saying well if there is both with arguments are the same as they're both rather than bus blue let me give it a slightly higher number than if they differ zero it out and then last we say ok will this last person prefers to go round but you know it's not hard constraint nothing like that an insulin again so like we took the last time assignments which is like if you have all your variables and you have all the dyes that you decided we have a couple of weeks and wait is this queen plug-in all the values your variables into factors and then multiplying them all up to get that Anne Hathaway in our go across all these problems this whole unit is to find assignments for all variables that will give us the maximum when we multiply up over Factor yeah yes the question wise why is the weight of product in artists and the editor for that is because an a constraint satisfaction if you look back at this example we wanted to control the constraint they must agree and we did that by 3 and 0 incentive movement up if you have a single factor that gives 0 it's like a pedo an end so that video powers actually really critical and we delivered it on Monday which are parquet but soon so on Monday we talked about one algorithm for solving this problem recorded at tracking and it's a kind of it exhausted you can think about is like a depth first search about the possibility so we have this example from what week where we were colouring provinces in Australia rate so we have I actually don't know the problem since Australia but we have we Tasmania on I work in my geography and so what will you say to do with this he will call q rabbits do it I know it's a hateful quality red let's go with green hair for Auntie and then we pick blue 4SA and then green for Anastasia and we've completed that tree we've gone as far as we can we found him calling at work we say always track up to this point Radisson Blu Inn 4nt instead of green which is what we had before animal can do the same thing we go down to the tree or we could try different colours 4QS of the number 13 tried to over here we take that tree down but just something that is is not outside fibre sofa I say no matter what colour we give it according to our factories which said I can't have two neighbouring colours unilad an and you fill up the tree this way and so this is the oven recovered and it works cos I always give you a good version but it's not working because it's super slow exponential time endnote and each node has a domain and so you're here it's like for each value of bike and ride out so like fortunate boys we had two fact if you had two variables X1 and x2 and they both took on three values so these are all that hairy balls and the guys didn't Akon and these are how much are factors like them then you have saved for each value in ex13 TRY in x 2 so is this exponential blow up which is just very slow and so we were in some kind of like your sister quiz to speed things up and prune of battery so we did Ford check which is weird like once you decide my value for one variable I'm going to go ahead and proper get that decision as far as I can that trumpet little bit with that dynamic ordering which is like ok which variable and I'm gonna choose work now and then I'm going to choose my value a little more intelligently I'm going to pick the thing that has the least with cos maybe they'll help and once and the helpless little bit but at the end of the day these constraints they help discriminatory but they can only work where constraints only if a factor give us a value of 0 does it work because that's when it has zero power and we use the videos to say this branch of the tree will never be useful so we can never go down so if we have factors that are going to be non-zero we can't use any of these thanks yeah example how you getting one and then I guess it's to the end - 1 and actually we doing lecture today we're gonna talk about exactly how you can go this morning smart will it so you just had two variables Lisa Newry Factor if you're running binary like that tracking we would still say rope will try all different combinations of both very boss which is very dumb thing to do yes so that's backtracking interested so will discover smarter ways to get around yes that's backtracking it is you the acquisition every time maybe mixpack so I'm gonna lead into the running of the whole lecture audit soda can you have sensors that are sign you like oh my object is here no it's down here it's over here and what you want to do with the operation and run of ucsd to infer and more realistic estimate were dodgy actually so I'm off to drop this on the board so so what this looks like is if we have this is a time so I call it T4 time and this is position preposition and what this is going to say is we have sensors that are giving us estimates noisy estimates for where this thing is everyone in time so for example maybe at times that one we get an obvious and down here add timestamp to it appear in a time step 3 its up here in reality like we might maybe something more like that and so that's going to be a go with this one example so this is how we got into a factor in this case we have variables where the variable is our gas for the real location for that object we have to cancel factors we have unary observation factors and that's a how close is our gas to the opposition to other centres anyhow transition factors which basically tell us you can't change your gas by too much from timestep to timestep so on this graph would it look like is it easier observations this is like 01-02 in 03 then maybe our first gas will be here so we have X1 X2 down here and then maybe you like x 3 appear an and no observation factors is going to look at this distance and that would what this is going to say it's OK how far is our estimate from the observation and they wanted to because and then I transition factors I'm gonna work are you going to look at this distance between one of 1 guests in the next guests and shouldn't be moving to yeah so the observation is what the sensor gives us any estimate is US saying thank you for the thank you Santa now I think the person is actually right here because the centre is noisy we can't trust yeah so that's how we're going to say this an I think suthers and and this is really cool collar job app that you can play around with when you're on time and I will briefly work into it so what's going on here is the documentation that you can but this would happen here is we just reading his variables we have three variables and were allowing anti-gun three positions same position 01-02 I'm and this is a little function as basically including the fact that if things are nearby then we want it to be like that so we have two variables in NF they're in the same position then return to we really like that if there only one away from each other we return one so it's ok will take it NF the 4th away then wanting each other then 0 that's a heart we don't like and then we have this observed function which is kind of a high-level thing and it kind of them I guess you could say it can I pre loads are nearby function with with a variable creative actors and then this is what it looks like so we have we have three variables X1 X2 X3 and we have our observation factors are you near me remember that say ok you have to be customer centre and then our transition back to the binary message you can't move too much between x and you can run it and there's actually output here and I'm gonna ignore most of this for now I think the thing that is import here is that we ran backtracking search and we found the optimum assign 7s cases 14 x 1 to 4 x 2 in 3 which gather finally I'm so on our little drawing basically with that saying is is it saying something like this is off the motorway we put we say thank you Santa for these estimates but we think the person is actually here at times that one here at 2 and here at 3 that's the solution that backtracking game yeah doodle weights world of the time steps 21211 what's the temperature at one of the next 2 x 74 so the question was what you mean by here at 3 and what I mean is basically so xx XI is an is H estimate for the position this and so at times z3r estimate for the position is at position to and let's OX2 nx3 so that's why there is excellent at 2 for both time this is like x wine Tours play understand how exactly is strange being yeah so the constraint here is so the fact that if you look at a nearby function and if a and b are further than one away from each other then it returns 0 another constraint because when we're calculating the weight of a factor we multiply together all the facts and sofa 0 in there in the whole week goes to zero an yeah yeah you can say that so that and will be returning to that few times awesome ok so will be on and backtracking search very slow let's try to speed up faster beam search so back I can search we have that tree analogy battrick and exhaustively searches the entire get off the solution but it's very slow an and so one way to avoid this car exhaust service is Greece which is where you greedily it's like for each variable you greedily selected are you there visit the highest weight so if you look at the voice can take on and you Tuesday 11 variable with value is and you never look back you just keep on running any go to the whole tree this way until you end up at a complete solution so the benefit is it's very fast right linear the con is that it's a very narrow window like you don't see one of the state space and so you can often miss the Global an so for people who prefer this conversation but we're doing as we basically say we weep for the variables and we try out every value and we just take whatever value has the highest yeah so view search is kind of like an in between backtracking and so when will the thing yeah yes so the question is explain agreed again and so with really what we're doing is as we say so we have we have a partial assignment right and we pick up we won't understand apostle so we take a new variable and we try out every single value that variable can take and we take the value that that give it the highest wait so all the factors touching that variable or the most happy with that value I pick that and we never look back and we pick a new variable inconsistency yeah so that's a good one week and inconsistent annataughtyou so you can actually really search you can actually kinda like find your way in canape whole where it's like oh damn I can't go any further in it's a big problem with really sore so with backtracking beam searches is Connor like a heuristic way that maybe get around so we've been searched so remember again in in so 4 greedy search we had one portal Simon right and we were choosing one variable and choose an extension of that one girl we've been search what you do is instead of one parcels I meant you maintain a list of k portals in this case for and then what you do is on Everest is for each of your parcel Simon's you pick a new variable you try all the wines and then what you do is you so yeah you keep auto sign out and you try to extend every personal sign Newcastle all the values for every partial sign and then you sort those personal statements based on the way and then you just take the top k so it's like you have your purse I meant you could send them into all the possible success you sort numbers and wait and then you take the top k so in this case if we have for parcels and Simon's and we try extending the mall in the two directions they can go and then we thought it done and then we took the four you can see this for things that I filled in that have the highest weight and we can do this procedure so you say so what we were doing this case we would say ok for each of these four solid things we're going to trial we're going to extending each other's portal sign and then we saw all the extensions and select the top so yeah yeah exactly the question was up to the park and the one is in case we sent it to Tuesday lesson case so we can extend completely so in patient yeah so we say fridge-freezer variable we try to extend each other personal Simon and then we pruneaux everything but they're ok Sky arm so babes searches also not guaranteed to find the best way b w school about it is that it cannot be like a knob that you can control between being greedy and explore no that's ok is very why then you explore more the tree and if he is actually infinity I think is on the side yes ok is infinity than that actually like into a breakfast entirety yeah wrap around the picture we had like the salad in the fridge self reasonable so I'm looking like I'm looking right here and in reality you would never extend because it was never selected appear so at this point we do consider it because we have sent down but then we decided not to say wow runtime so for sofa being search you're selecting a single I meant and for each person assignment you're trying out every value in the domain Ibiza size of your domains and then you try not be things for every person Simon and York a portal sign that's right does the number of extension do you have his baby and then you sort them into sore it take if you have a list of like and sorting as in login and so you sort the list of KB that because KB locatie and then there is any knows that you need to hit the streets City dispense so like I said beam search and give you this really cool knob between you and everything or do you want to focus in on on been passing Green so everything until now what we've covered is is extending portal sign in so we have we giving like a blank slate picture of Australia with no colours and Cal Australia this house and now we're going to talk about is OK give him a map of Australia that sorry for that covers colour how do we make changes to it in order to improve it next local so the first algorithm is called iterated conditional modes ICM I'm in what I cm is doing is this is ok we pick one variable anime ass what is the new setting that we could choose this variable that would improve the overall so in this case we have 1 variables x 2 and we try all the different I can take on which is 01 02 I meant for each other's that as we go through and recompute the way and then we pick whenever value is that so it's 4:00 and here it looks like one is a better choice so we all that and from this now onwards a x 2 is equal to so something cool about ice is that when you're evaluating a new value for a variable you only need to consider factors that touch that very well that's all you really need to be is everything else is constant with respect to it's like a big time savings in track one last thing is so the name in recognition made so interested come to the fact that you can sort the horses free this way you just over which variable you still acting unconditional means that once you've so like a very bored you're clamping down the vows of everything else and then was the same once you select a variable you you try out every single day for that very yeah would you like Kali yeah so the question is if you if you have your variables you keep on going through them in and choosing one come and pick the others and then choosing the best are you for it would you rather than also solution and at the end so Emsworth in practice year yeah so again this this is just give you an illusion that we literally the variables and variable we pick a weight that improves it so we have this in the demo so in this case what's going on here is very saying ok right now we select a next one we start with a random initialisation we start we looking at 1 an these the different tyres to X1 could take on and then we go through and calculate the Wii say ok when is the best weight for X11 so we choose one to BS1 and we step again we're looking at you now and it looks like actually a value of one is better for X2 and so from now on which was the guy of 14 x and we again now looking at 3 and looks like which is the value of 1 and you just keep on innovating through this until you hit some kind of local offer and I'm saying this important that is a local offer because right now it's converted so I can keep on pressing step and it's not going to change but the week is for and if you remember doing the other thing when you're and backtracking we actually found in assignment with so it does it can fall in his local offer one way around this is like an algorithm called Gibbs sampling with Gibbs sampling what we do is we injected some randomness into the process to try to like 1% bumper Saturday's local up the man into something that I can maybe get us into better area so basically give them playing is super somewhere Lyceum the only difference is that instead of so you you try all the values and instead of selecting the guy that give you the biggest weight new sample the value According with probability that proportional to it's so we say setting a zero with give us one by one we have to live together so we have to I meant to get the probability sweetie wait we some but we divided by the total which would this be 5 with some all up into bye-bye is the 5.2 so here we said it's 2 / 5 which is 1 + 2 + 2 and then we use that probably distribution to ST4 a new Value for X2 instead of just using it so you're the best so this is the demo so in this case were looking at 1 and we're trying out different possibilities for it and we have weights and then they give us a probability distribution in wee sample from this problem this case it looks like we sampled and we chose 04 and then we keep a record of how many times with ended up with a certain designer selfie step again now looking at x 2 and it looks like X1 and one is everything we choose that dial we added to the car and you can just keep on running this process Andover time you build up this can I call David distribution an solicitors acting on micro SIM so I had 0.20% chance of choosing one 80% chance of season 2 but it still chose one that's a way that it can come brake pads local Optima but in any case if you look at this table then what you find is that overtime if you run this thousands of times then I'm in practice I'm settings with very high weights will occur very often an actually when we get into problems that graphical models which person will talk about Sue and you could actually say that the global optimum will be the most in Gibbs sampling in the limit which is I think pretty cool yeah ok so just just an example of what can go wrong with this over them it's still so if we have X1 we have access to what's a Mercedes two people in a trying to say very good at so we could have vegetarians and going for a steakhouse so we have FIFA Brazilian and us first day covers and they really both want to go to vegetarian and I want it together and they eat steak but they're not super crazy about it so if you're in this state then even if you doing Gibbs sampling it's really hard to bounce over here because you have these to candlelight transitionary settings in between in order to make you both vegetarian they're going to have one is going to have to make the decision to go to different rest this is so low priority it's very difficult finishing people to go over a they're both kind of like oh I want to do what you need you want to do steakhouse how many do you need to take house my then both don't really know that they will be much happier over all tables an this would really be even worse if if you had so if you had like 0 is here then there's actually no way for them to get there there's no probability there yeah whatever you think is very important to state that you're in in general in opposition an in any kind of opposition area work where you can have the power of pulling into some kind of local optimum that's worse than the Globe off advertisement on UNIQLO yeah cos if you're here then you'd fall somewhere goodbye 01 and so the question was what if you initialised into a state that has 0 probability so what you would do if you would say is you would select a variable you would like that one and then you would try different values plus you would say ok I'm going to either choose s or V holding a stick on in that case transitioning to be would have a probability of 1 so you would do that almost eternity sell for Gibbs sampling Deezer powder tournament who does the klarify.me Gibbs sampling is not guaranteed is not guaranteed yes but that's so that's not like that kind of a free radical so in the limit doesn't mean like I guarantee I guess you didn't so I guess this is directly about your car so if you require these questions and which ones are guaranteed to give you the max and the only one is back coz greedy is too narrow beam search is maybe too narrow ICM is 2 mi and Gibbs sampling is it's not a guarantee it's likely but it's not guarantee yeah can you say this evening and that stupid so if you if you initialise right here there's no way for you to get up I think it's just in certain condition yeah so that I wasn't that wasn't easy guys so that it was a free radical pt3 like some subsets some cspc yeah support initialised at stake steak it's there's no point that we can go too late vegetable right because the middle transmission protocol 0 is it that morning a problem with Gibbs sampling you should never even if you just give them some excellent go to Doc yes no question was and is it worthwhile to add some like plus 0.0001 today's just to give it some probability and I and my intuition says that sounds like a pretty good idea it sounds like adding tenable.io plans to avoid division by 0 bye I think you would depend on the know yourself so you can imagine some cases where you want ok so just a summer so far we've learnt two ways of extending partial Simon says his grass no one is backtracking search last time which is like a full search Alexa give you the exact solution every time super slow name searches approximate and I give you the school will not to trade off an speed and I guess you can say like success exactness I meant second one ways to giving her assignment to improve it tomorrow one was ICM which was approximate and then there is something which is also proximate buy it uses some probability and then some random an hour going to look at it will get two ways to solve this comes up Rob by actually changing the structure of the graph itself sir motivation comes from Australia arm Tasmania that is that is so Tasmania if your number was disconnected so I think we call it red in a free Singapore but it doesn't really matter what get it right give anything and so what we wine is we went to the library to this property and more than leverage it we went to we want to come up like inject this property into graphs that don't exist we like we want to like bill is probability and is probably out of grass so first we won't like what is this call independent Anakin speed things up so just like I said before so is it still there it's partially right so if we write this down again so this is the same as before we have two variables Edgware a unary Factor on it an with backtracking search I told you what happened you something really dumb which you do it if I 24 lives right you try every combination of the music centre where is really do is just say ok for each thing I'm gonna choose the value that maximises that makes my tractor enough linear and so that would give us a more efficient algorithm oh no ok and we call it properly independent so a n so this case x 1 and extra and a reasonable independent is a snow Factor connector there's no pass between them there's no edges between and so we cover and that's the same thing with Tasmanian the rest of Australia an sorry know how independent is like it's only in terms of like Mac called graph theory this is this kind of like in Python that's enough so yet so like me send tasmania's independent an what about cases like this so it's not quite enough in it but it's almost independent you know only if x 1 existed in the restaurant I'm so that this is very interesting idea and conditioning is a way to rip nodes out of a graph so if we do that by by saying ok in this example there is one annexe 2 and then it's what's 22 1732 01732 red red red blue blue red 2 3 repaying X1 X2 are connected to telly with a back derailleur fight what if I say X2 is definitely blue yeah yes the question was can problems be written as all of them yes yeah because fat variables are loading factors so it actually really elegant way to think about it cuz then you can bring all this graph theory can you also see the board ok what are rates play ok so if I say X2 is definitely blue I trust me then what's that mean let me cross out all the rows wormax2 is not blue so here X2 is red so I can be like you are never going to happen I know you're not the case you're not and for you same thing you are not happy and at once I fix x2 I don't olive excuse by the sea so this doesn't really add information to the table and I can doesn't drop that dinner from the table in what that gives me is it give me reduced table which is just a Euro factor of X1 and it can take on red or blue and I have a value of 7 if I choose red and two if I choose blue and graphically with that looks is I'm the weeding x 2 and I just have one Factor now x 1 and has Una a fact and now the price to pay for that was I had to assume that X2 was how to condition on extubating blue an so notational or maybe I programmatically I think a good way to think about it is it's kind you taking this the factor that touches x 2 in your pipe reloading it with a value for one of the arguments I meant the rest of his aunt so you choose a value for a variable you remove the value and the variable from the graph and then you sticking that value preload the associated factors with that so if word condition is I'm saying sa is green and blue eyes red trust me animal that is is it ripped those out of the grass and everything touching everything touching those conditions very boss turns into some kind of a stamp can you preload the value of variables in and the only Edge that gets removed here is the one that connects essays in and because you have a function that takes two arguments but you preloaded both of those arguments already it's done there's nothing to do there mattswhatitis I'm just in the new factors are going so auntie for example that win this factor which used to say auntie and you can't have the same colour it turns into this whole thing which TNT can be red and you know that because you are swimming at q your condition on the fact that yeah is it variables have no or know that next so the question is Independence no Edge it is Independence mean is there no Edge between them or is there no password an we will talk about that so for independence you need both true but then we're going to cover in another form of anything it's called conditional independent which is the better yeah do you like starting with partial sound on grass can you can yes to the question words how is this different from extending parcel timer and it's not so that's actually good point I think so conditioning my activate case of building at partial Simon this so I think the main thing to think about is now it's kind of like moved on so parcel sign extending portal Semington modifying existing that was kind of like our old world which is where like this graph structure is very perfect and we can't touch it or change it now in a new world where we are allowed to change the structure of the and so we kind of like laugh that weird things yeah subway to rent what price did Aston profits have shooting his dad I will get in touch yeah exactly two condition goes to yes to the question why do we choose a condition he's so this is arbitrary but soon forward houses different from for checking so in Ford checking but we would do is we were proper getting the decision forward an to reduce the domain of existing fact where is in this one we are we're changing the structure of the graphics and where Rome Italy removing very balls and inserting new fact so turn move on graphic in general what this looks like is if you have a variable that you want to condition and you rip another and then everything that touches it turns into some kind of a stud with the value preloaded in there this is just a picture of the same idea yeah so I guess you can say this is the moon this is a big difference is that where is in for propagation we were keeping the existing graph in word propagating a decisions to reduce them where is now where we're literally removing this variable and the factors with it and adding new factors and that are preloaded ok so we are going to now go to the US and conditional upon so if you have three if you have three variables A B and C set timer NB then you would say that Amy or conditionally new condition on see what you pick a value for c remember these turn into Stubbs are stamps or whatever you want to call them g and so these are now independent we used to not be dependent because they could access to each other through see but now they're independent there is no Edge connecting there's no way to reach each other and so this is just a way of saying that this is how we write it so we condition on Sea and then a and b become yeah so come on you say every path for me to be ghost and then that means if you remove see then there's no past I'm so in this example I sent you if you condition on then you rip another and then it looks like western and eastern Australia are not independent of each other because they turned into Ireland and that's riding it mathematics so there is another notion of the Markov blanket which is basically saying ok I want to make I've chosen some subset of the graph in this case is a v and I went to make it independent what is what what are the variables I have to destroy in order to make my variable in Ireland and so in this case it will be essay in Ennis today if you condition on these then becomes an island ent if you wanted to make this subset independent the new condition on Q in Sa and the set of nodes and that you have to condition on is called the mark of going oh that have no that you want to be in the so it's like if you have some partner graph anyone make it independent of a part b they and see is kind of like the Markov blanket of a when you delete it becomes independent this thing this is kinda like a set notation thing it's a set difference and this is just out WaveRunner nomadically so we can use these ideas 2 till I create independent structures other day so we had this example before almost but not quite now that we can do is making condition on it so we can listen listen be red and then we can find the maximum weight for the rest of it which was easy before right with this example it's just like what's the best what's the best for you so once we condition on this thing that's making an then it mean the poem becomes very easy so what we do to solve this and if we just condition repeatedly we say ok I have picked my nose now for red green and blue bovet conditioning salt conditioning salt conditioning salt in a quick and then you can read off the mass and weight very easy you just so it's green because that was the one after collision yeah so the product the question was what weeks what does that mean and this is it's kinda loosey-goosey it's not fair for me to find but this is my would say it's the weight of the hold ignition on this and then you'll find the best that I use for all these variable and then you take the I've all of those unary Factor and that gives you and we this is just the numbers arbitrary yeah Argentina all possible combinations anyway so it is so you cover every solution that backtracking with you this would give you 2 arm this is much bass because what you doing if you're taking a very complicated problem and you're breaking it into easily solvable pieces you taking an exponential problem and you're breaking into linear number of linearly solvable and in practice match yes set the question was instead of doing instead of exactly searching all variables years actually searching just a couple terrible and yeah that's thinking about it I think in both in both ways if you think about it it's like even if you conditioning for every single very but you're eventually going to consider all of the values that can take on but you're you're you're re-ordering things in a way that much more and that lets you take care like this independence any more questions on this yeah so it be so it is faster than and you can see here so for example if we did backtracking here it would be what is 3 calories in a 7/3 so it would be the future expansion if we can listen here then it becomes much more so just summarise independence is when we have a and b and they can't there's no way to get from A to B conditioning is when we we take that we take very login Italia ripping all the grass and then I preload all the factors attached yeah switch on the lights I'll finish this dependence is when you have to box in your graph and if you condition on one party then if you rip that out then is to become separated I'm in America blanket is sang ok I want to make my very bored and I'll what noise do I have to destroy to make it yeah 0 unsure whilst on probation if you condition on next one like your best you started turn off set of unary factors for each of the love each other drug names so so in this case so doing backtracker backtracking Sophie did bachelor in Derby what's 7 to the right lecturer who is Ella and then if we did conditioning so that be 3 for the condition right Annan every time we condition we do and 7 x 3 rate 6 x 3 6 times so this is 6 squared x it depends I don't I don't I don't know exactly what is this is Cavan arbitrary again but I think I think the point the point here is that this is my heart rate so this is this is 3 of 4/3 an so it's fast yeah yeah Daniel so this was saying this is saying that it's three colours 4 x 1 and everytime I choose a colour for X1 I'm saying that three options for each of the 6 other things so once once once I've set x 1 it turns into this situation when I'm saying what's the best value 4 x 1 ok so I will get three things in Tuesday now what's the best life hacks to look at three things and choose the best and soda now there's six of these and each 14ich item I had to consider it 3 different possibilities yeah I don't you know it will probably be different depending on what this what the actual factors are in with your calculating it's just an arbitrary example I'm ok so now we're going to do with them an elimination is very cool I think so listening is saying I'm a rip my Google add a graph on then I'm going to plug in whatever value I conditioned on into all the neighbouring Factor illumination says is ok to ring my phone but instead instead of plugging in a single value across every single Factor I'm going to pudding a different value perfect in order to individually optimise decision arm so I think I think it's best showing through temple so again this is the thing we have two variables are connected by Factor and they have these sweets if we condition then and we I think this is this example write so we can listen we get we have before amen if we eliminate an here I'll do the Elimination so I'm going to read rather stable so we have X1 annexe to red red red blue blue red blue blue weights of 17 3 until so what illumination is going to do is is wee wee condition it like internally off the misers decided that we don't want to based on the other argue in that fact so we would say ok we're trying trying to with my ex to right now can we do that by looking at YouTuber ux1 can take and then 42 value with an employee choose the best value for x so first we look at Red so X1 is red what's the best value for X2 in Ruby Blue so we cross-eyed this we say if X1 is blue then excuse can be read because that gives us the Deezer and then just like before now for any value of x 1 the value of X2 is already set it's fixed it's decided and so that means that we can draw this variable out of the graph because we've already like internally optimise into this phone what it said would be and so this gives us again and cable where we had X1 we are the guys I can take on red and blue and then we have the weights associate with that which is not 7 and 3 an so in math what that looks like is is where we used to have this binary Factor we've now ripped x2hr grass and we have this new Factor is a unitary fraction which internally optimises over x2 it says give me my x 1 give me an X1 and then I seem to get my ex back I'm going to spin through my values of X2 and give you the best one that would the best so what this would look like in the poorly I guess is every time you remove a factor and you take all the factors that touch it and you broke them all together and you merge them anz into one big factor and then internally what the back is doing is it authorising over whether we just remove so for example if we have sofa temple we have this kind of colouring problem what's a we want X1 to be read and export be read what's the best value of x 3 that we could get so over here we say as one is red exteriors red because is valid for I know 304 red red Business by once we have a one in here the other value that extra take on with the blue so now we go from red to Blue which gives a survey of 1 and then blue to red which gives us a weight of 2 is remote wireless together with 1 x 2 x 2 an internally with the factors going to do is going to maximize over there and choose the value for the deleted variable that maximizes that internally off lokal Prague which in this case is so just another example if we did red blue so S1 is red and blue and there's two options for x340d red so if we go from red to red that's for an infrared the blue is to 4 x 2 Annan and the next thing would be if actor is blue so we go from red to blue which is 1 and then blue to blue which is 1 add 1 x 1 and then we would say oh well in this case the best value of x 3 red internally optimise in general what this looks like is you rip the note at the you take all the factors that used to touch it and you time or together into one big factor and then again that's kinda back there is another way of interpreting this and that might be helpful to some people basically it's like you like I pick my value and then I'm going to look at all the all the variables in this market blanket I'm going to repeatedly condition for every on every assignment that blanket can take on and then for conditioning what's the best value of my selected variable that's kind of what's going on yeah faster execution * yeah so the question was if it's faster to rip out very boss what we can do for the whole day and we probably a couple of them so like we have the strategy for working out the rules and then the next episode use it to solve this which is what we like arm ok so there's this question which I think it's cool so we have some kind of a star shaped graph so if we have a setup but say we have a set like this factors going into our hub and we have we have this variable kolokas do we want to run elimination or conditioning honest Garrison whisperers yeah yeah condition and the reason for that is that if we if we condition then all these turning to you know if actors and if we eliminate then it turns into one giant actor which is tortoise ok so like you're saying this this this is so basically what you do is you you look drivable and you're living at the moment and then at the end of the day you were going to have one very to rule them all and that variable will just hold the yeah can we not want to kids wear using condition turn down possibility doesn't matter like can we still end up somewhere that's not good anatoly trousseau first anniversary is a discussion on exactly that very boring in it actually hurts my complete problem is to decide the best play so an only one more day run elimination on a whole graph which I think would be helpful so r graph so we have three variables we have x we have why Z and they're all connected 0 single Factor the whole table for this so we have x we have YZ let's say and they have two guys that could be A or B so we have a a b I'm around this a v e aib hey ba b a b a and be everything 0345 yeah so play Israel buy any straight so we can stay there 1234 5 6 78 people make this out seems like maybe I will go with let's say we want a Tuesday 1st June at Liberty so what you doing elimination is we say for all the variables in sees Markov blanket were going to repeat the condition on the values that they can take I never going to dynamically choose the value of Z that would test match so X and Y could either be a and a so this is a a and in this case the best value CBD right so we cross up next X and Y can be a b in which case the best buy USA sweetheart Stout it could be ba which would be Arrochar B&B an in the best value of Z in this case we can be so again like we've seen a couple of times before now for any value of X and Y the value of these are decided free so we can just drop this variable fun or table which is equivalent to dropping it from a graph so now we're going to work and why again we do the same thing we say for each for each value in why is Mark which is AXE we repeatedly condition on all the possible that I can take on and then dynamically choose the best of piss off so if x is a so now comparing an hour comparing these two so xsa what's the best value of y it be so we can cross this out now if x is b what's the best value of y it's again beats we can cross this out and now again for every value of x we've decided by and so we can drop this from the graph and now that we have is now we have one very boner grab with a unitary Factor an xx an acting ba or it can be b and if access a hazard and access that has a value of and how we can do it we can just say ok we're going to XTube I meant income of implementation all you need to do is it sound like look back you can store some Cannock back pointers or store your old people's and you can recover your solution from the whole go from this end so that is that is variable information yeah why do we go in the opposite order from 10 to 1 set of 1 to 10 oh that's so that's basically lowest price that kind of is a mathematical way of saying what I just said about the back burner so tired now we're going forward with automated and now I can go back we say ok xsb no we've decided x 2BB we look at our old table and be like what was the best value of y that give us that decision so it's gonna wake once you go forward to eliminate you get your solution and then you go back in Microsoft advisors ok so I'm in terms of run time basically what you can say is silver each variable it's going to have domain to the so every variable is going to have domain to the early the factor touching so the factors touching like the factor you create formerly meaning of variable is going to have this many rows in it and then there's and variables that you have to limit an with the wired the reason why it's not early is because if you have let's say you had some kind of grass that looks like yes and this factor would be d squared the Divine squared and in this backward BD3 and so like I said you're going as your illuminating going through this graph like this is just gonna die D2 so it's as you going home alone again the early of the biggest factory created is going to be down there perform and that was very boring but then so was it yeah yeah so the pot one I'm not actually sure I I thought I looked I looked around and I wasn't so ok so how's it going for the matters because if you look at this there's two ways to do it right so if you want from the leaves in a limited each loop variable first then all factors of greatwood hurdle BBC but if you women X1 first then get the future giant Factor they give you this big table of this early sick give me a riddle so the order really matter in general it makes sense to eliminate variables with the fewest Neighbours first at the pretty like sensible hero sticker and practice works well and we define this term called True with which is saying if you had actigraph and you're going through during elimination and the background of a factor they create a longer way using the best order is the truth of that glass so in general our truth is is very very hard to compute but for a few cases you can kind of Reason about it so free Netflix he had a chain so we had a chain and if I was going through this the biggest factor of 3 is just a union that little get raped Security one if I had a tree so it's just like I've never before so if you go from the waves again you can create These Little Fockers Angelina Factors in C can get away with 1 if you had a psycho I'll make myself a little if you had a psycho the maximera is going to be too nico's even if even if you I work away from the sides you're eventually going to end up that's something I just connect the last thing before you delete sounds like you have your cycle and you truly are both ends and you're going to end up with something with just those two notes and then if you had a if you're invited so let's say this just goes on it's the smaller of the two and the reason for that is because if you but so you go through when you're living in these things you might like that you're going to end up with something Santa where's my bike I want to delete this you're really gay effector that rubs not together Celeste super important article pause music yeah yeah you're right so it's not the first us it's the first to say when your let's say this is my psycho the first factory create after I delete is going to be a binary thank you yeah so just a sunrise we were in different ways of solving csp today and beam search which is kind of like a souped-up version of backtracking it doesn't always be the answer but it's faster local search you get entire things and then you improve them conditioning and break up the graph into smaller pieces that are easier to valve and an elimination which is where is Comic-Con conditioning except instead of choosing one value for your tractor and you cannot like dynamically choose the value based on the market so we will see you on Wednesday
