Pakistan so today's lottery going to be on Logic tomorrow waiting I want to start with hopefully easy question so if x1 + X2 Estate X1 - X2 X4 what is someone shouting 7 how did you get 7 yeah you do that algebra wanna go right so what's the point this is they are connected by two and you could in principle go and use that to try different values of X1 and x2 until you eventually arrived at the clearly this is not really somehow in this problem there's extra structure that we can leverage to arrive at the answer in a match and this time of our going to be the poster child white working Explorer today next Monday's lecture how are you can do logical inference to arrive at moustache so we've arrived at the end of the other class and I wanted just reflect a little I'm always this will be exam I'm so in this class with busted everything on the modeling inference learning paradigm in the picture you should have in your head is this abstractly we take some data perform some learning on it and we producing more I'm using a model we can produce a perform inference which looks like taking in a question and return answer what is this look like for all the different types of institutions with what Dad's sofa search problems the marvellous is a search problem and the invoice has the question what is the minimum cost path Amin MB please and games we asked the question what is the maximum value policy NCS please we asked the question what is the maximum wireless and networks we can answer probabilistic inference queries of the form what is the probability of some query variables condition on some evidence preacher this case we look at the marlin we look at the the influence of Williams and then we look that different types of learning procedures going back to his maximum-likelihood we looked at are various reinforcement learning algorithms with structure perceptron hopefully this is kind of sums up the kind of world view that system one is trying to impart is that there are these different no components and depending on what kind of modelling you choose you have different types of algorithm I'm alone infantile g ammonia Castle we looked at several polling card roughly broken into three categories the first step is model search problems mdpc games in here I'm the the way you think about my leg is in terms of states and as nodes in a graph in actions that take you between different states Whitton curry there a cost or give you some sort of reward in your goal is just to find pan or contingent Pandora policy Andy Powell when was shifted gears to talk about variable based models where instead we think about variables amen and factors that constrain or these variables to check on certain types of data so in today's lecture I'm going to talk about magical beasts lockout propositional logic AND first-order logic which are two different types of logical languages are and we're going to think about logical formulas in in which is going to be another way of her thinking about mummy in the world historical logic was actually the dominant paradigm in AI before that I might be hard to believe now but imagine the amount of excitement that is going into Deep learning today yes equal amount of excitement was going into logical based but there is have two problems with magic one is that magic was deterministic so didn't handle uncertainty that's why I probably stick inference in other methods were developed to address this and also rub it which allows didn't allow you to naturally ingest a large amount of data guided heavier and the emergence of machine learning has addressed one Strange Kind of husband left on the table is the Express and I emphasise about Lodge as you gives you the Billy needs to express very complicated things in a very and that is kind of the main point of logic which I really want everyone untenable hopefully this I'm as I'm already on the first day of class the reason I want one good way to think about why we might want a lodger imagine you wanna Lila beach and you want your assistant to be able to do things for you but hopefully it's more like data from Star Trek rather than Siri you want to take an assistant you want to be able to Alice tell information and ask her questions and have these questions actually be answer and response to reflect the information that you are told so just kind of a brief refresher on Thursday of class I showed you this demo where you can talk to the system and say things ask questions so exam Australian like right it's important things and Alice does not like 1 and then you can ask student no because I can be a reason about arm injustice under the hood a little bit inside it has some sort of knowledge base stack as well come back so this does assistant needs to be digest heterogeneous information in the form of national language and he has to reason deeply without it conscious I've kind of suggest a natural language interface natural language is very powerful because I can set up your and use natural language to give Alexa and hopefully you guys understand some of but let's go with metal and so who is an example of how you can bright inferences using ok so time is better than Echo a Nicolas better than a penny so therefore time is better so this seems like pre sound reasoning so what about this example is better than nothing nothing is better than world peace therefore it is better than Morocco right ok so something clearly went wrong here and this is because languages natural languages kind of slippery it's not very precise next a very easy to make these on business x but if we step back and think about 1 the role of natural language is really language of self is the next mechanism for expression are there many types of languages does natural languages there is programming languages which are you you are not familiar with but we're going to talk about different type of language called logical languages programming languages are going to be 4 so we're going to be absolutely clear what we mean by when we have a steam a logical language but like natural language it's going to be on the Claire Dev on and this is my little bit harder to appreciate right now but it's means that there is calibre more of a one-to-one isomorphism between logical languages and natural languages as a comparator on programming languages and on so in a lot of Our Language we want to I have two properties personalised poem which should be enough to represent knowledge about the wall arm and secondly it's not sufficient just to represent the knowledge because your hard drive from representing all lights but you have to be able to use analogy in a way to reason water contains 3 ingredients which are I'm go through in a subsequently there is a syntax which defines alarm what kind of expressions are valid or grammatical in the slang and their semantics which is for each expression or formula what is it mean meaning is actually mean something very precise whichever Remembrance Rose allow you to take various formulas and you can operations on just like in the beginning with when we have the algebra problem you can add equations you can move things with different sides you can perform these rows which are synthetic manipulations on the formulas or pressure preserve some sort of ok so just talk about syntax vs semantics lol I think this might just always start Point which hopefully will be clear with it actually first two what are the valid expressions in this language Informatics is about what expressions meme example of 2 expressions which have different syntax 2 + 3 is not the same singers 3 plus two have the same same what I mean the number music case where we have to expressions with the Simpson tax re / 2 but they have different matter did Daniel which so in order to define a language precisely you only have to specify that syntax but also the magic just by looking at the sun actually don't actually know what is and there's a bunch of different logic's the ones Highline in Bordeaux the ones I'm going to actually talked about in this class so today's lottery is going to be I'm on propositional Logic and then in the next life when I look as with most models in general there's going to be a trade-off between the expressivity and a competition efficiency so as I go down this list to fertilise you can be on I'm going to be able to express more things using the language but it's going to be hard to do our competition in that Lang ok so this is the camera key diagram having your head while I go through syntax semantics and in for every I'm going to do this for propositional logic and then money is like I'm going to do it for first order so just to get it on a board syntax what we have Netflix then we have entrance rolls I'm so this one is going to have a lot of definitions and concepts on just give you one if there's a lot of pain of ideas I'm very kind over on the board by themselves in the canopies together but there's just going to kind of I tried to write them on the board so that so in order define a logic call language I need a Spotify what are the form on 1 million other comment about logic is that some of you probably taken as one of three that we've been exposed to propositional Logic what I'm going to do here is kind of them much more method watch call river streaming advert I want to see the difference between being able to do logic yourself like if I gave you some logical expression you can manipulate that's different then talking about the general setup algorithms that can operate I'm magic so right so remember we're not interesting you guys doing logic because that's I'm bad were interest in developing general principles or general algorithms I can actually do that just I can go in the bayesian network it's very fine well there you can you guys can manipulate and condition calculate conditional and marginal probability yourself but the whole point is we devise album by Gibbs sampling and variable elimination I can work on so what's a BJ this is going to be building from the Ground Up the first of all there are in propositional Logic there are a set of propositional symbols these are the uppercase letters or even I'm word these are the atomic four and these are formulas that can be any smaller there is going to be logical connectives such as and not and or implication and bidirectional implication and then the set of formulas are built up recursive Devonshire formula then I can these are also formulas I can have not f i can have F&F or GF employees due in bi-directional invocation equivalent better ideas here or we have propositional symbols on this things like doctors rights to formulas in general which is going to be denoted on app and so here are some examples here's a formula in particular tonic formula which is a propositional symbol not a is a formula not be and formula this is a formula this is a formula Dublin occasion is fine this is not a formula because there's no connected between a and not b this is also not for me like because what the heck is Plus it's not a connective I think thinking about logic you really have to divorce yourself from the comments answer your come in Tbilisi that is just a symbol or is just a symbol and they don't have any semantics in fact I can go in to find some somatic so should be completely different than what you imagine it will be valid logical just symbols on period defining is what symbols are valid and what SIM any questions about the syntax of propositional on the syntax gives you the set of formulas were basically statements you can think about us as this is our language we could only speak and propositional logic I could say they are not for the or I may imply see that's all I would be able to say and of course now I have to tell you what do these things mean and this is the RAM of cymatics so somatics there's going to be a number of definitions the first is a moral so this is really unfortunate confusing terminology but this is standard in The Logical letter so I'm just going to use our model which is different from our general notion of a model example of a market model for several models in propositional Logic just reversed an assignment of suicide used to proposition if you have £3 and symbols there a possible model ears are 1060 Idina just complete a Simon that we saw from tachographs but now being this new so that's the first in a first-order logic and also going to be more complicated I'm Brunel think about them is complete because sometimes you also call them world because I complete a Simon flat immoral is supposed to represent the state of the world 1 yeah so the question is can eat proper December either be true or false and in Logic as I'm present m 400 so these are models amen next is a key thing that actually define cymatics which is interpretation interpretation function arm text or formula animal.and Returns through if that formula is is true in this model in false otherwise so I can make interpretation function whatever I want and I just gives me the status so when you're talking about what it's emetics it's the interpretation funk function I am so the way they think about this is I'm going to represent formulas as these horizontal so this is think about this is so I think you said it's it outside though reality and then this but I'm going to draw on the space of all possible models the thing about this is the space situations that we could be in the world an appointee correspond to a particular turn interpretation function takes one of formula text tomorrow in says is the same a true if the world look like this suggested Grandis out on a little bit more I'm going to find this for propositional logic again recursively I'm so for propositional symbols I'm just going to interpret that propositional symbol as a look oh come on hey Izzy true white go tomorrow on model and I see why they say it's true or false that's a base case so recursively I can define the interpretation of any formula in terms of its sub formulas in the where do this is suppose I have to formulas fng and they're interpreter and somewhere ok and now I took all the formula that ifng what is interpretation of fng I'm in w well is given by the truth table so acid 0ng introvert to be 0 then fng is Elton 01 maps 2010-2011 map you can verify that this is kind of your intuitive notion of what and should be on or is 1 arm at least one of f and G are one implication is 1 if 0 or ears are 1 I'm bidirectional implication just means that if the same thing I'm not f no clue ok so this life gives you the four somatic so nothing there's no logic at least the definition of what it is I'm going to go through example and then so look at this formula not a and b bi-directional implications and this model is 1 days 10 I'm how do I interpret this formula against this model well I look at the tree on which breaks down the formula cervelo kettle leaves on the bottom interpretation of a yes we is just one because four problem symbols I just look up what a is an interpretation of not a 0 because if I look back at this table if this virus the one then this virus it's on the table BS 125 table lookup and then I'm not A&E is 0 because I just take these two values and I and an 0 by table lookup and then bi-directional location is interpreted as one here because 0 is play some funky music yeah so the question is is the interpretation function this define it is just written down this is it there's no learning it's just these are this is why you is that usual defining a sense that that everyone's going out go define their own on some Editions came out send that are you going to find you set a timer for 5 any other questions about interpretation functions and models Ronaldo kind of connecting syntax and semantics right so interpretation function formulas which are in Santa's sleigh 2 notion of models which are Maddox a lot of logic is very you might seem a little bit pedantic but it's just because we're trying to be very rigorous in a way that doesn't need to appeal to your common sense intuitions about what is funny any questions alright so so why we have interpretation function is defined everything it's really going to use for the think about formulas in a slightly different way so what do you think about the formula I'm as representing on the set of all models for which interpretation is Emma Vass which is this is the set of models arm that is true on that Mum so Kate really this is a that you say lol and what you mean by this is simply this subset of model which this is true it's a Vine make a statement here what I'm really saying is I think we're in one of these models and not in one of these that's important I think intuition to have the meaning of my formula is carving out a space of possible situations that I say there's a water bottle on the table when I'm really sing is that I'm running out all the possible worlds we could be in where there is no water table bottle on no morals I am off us is going to be us subset of all the possible models so hurting example device say it's either raining or wet rain or what then the set of models can be represented on by this subset of this to buy ESO over here I have rain over here about what this corresponds to no rain but it's wet outside discord monster it's raining but it's not outside the set of models of is red region which are these possible I'm going to use this kind of Victoria depiction does one key idea here remember I said that logic allows you to express very complicated and large things by using very small secure I have a very small formula that's able to represent a set of models in that set of models could be exponential and much of the power of logical comes from the building ok so who's yet another definition this one's not somehow such a new definition sorry I knew answer but it's kind of just find give us a little bit more intuition for what is formalising so knowledge base is just a set of formulas I'm think about this is the set of facts you know about a boy this is why you have in your head and in general it's going to be a just a set of formulas canals the key thing is I need a connected with somatic so I'm going to define the set of model the notifier knowledge base to be the intersection of all the models didn't notify the form this case if I have rain or snow being this ring in traffic mean vs ready then the moles denoted by the knowledge bases you can think about knowledge is Hellfire Green arweave kind of zoomed in on where we are in the initially you don't know anything with anything is possible to to the new moles appear and as you add formulas insurance knowledge base the set of impossible worlds that you think are possible is going to shrink arm and you know what's it hadn't ok so here is an example of an always base of so have rain course answers this side of models I'm raining play Sweat corresponds with this set of model an EFI look at the models of this knowledge base is just going to be the inner section which is this squared any questions about knowledge bases models interpretation alright so is overloaded to earlier knowledge basis thing you having head and as you go through life you're going to add more formulas to an ology learn more things I'm so your nose base just gets Réunion with whatever formula you have add overtime the set of morals is going to shrink just taking anal sex arm and one question is how much is a shrink so here there is a bunch of different case to a party the first cases in tournament so suppose this is your knowledge base so far and then someone tells you the formula that corresponds to this sete so in this case intuitively f doesn't add any information or new constraints that was in particular if you take intersection of these to you and up with exactly the same setup you don't learn anything and this is called entailment so Lewisham services entitlement which is written this way with two horizontal bars which means that the set of models of f is at least as large as the set of models another one so for example rain and snow if you're in new is raining snowing someone tells you it's no it then you say well analyse I'm a second case is contradiction so if you believe the world to be in here somewhere and someone told you it's actually a here their mum your brain explodes so this is the word the set of models of the knowledge base in the cinema nearby the formula is empty that doesn't make sense hey so if I knew it was rainy and silly and someone says it's actually not snowing there in Europe ok so the third case is basically everything else it's contingency wear on ass has a non-trivial amount of information to analyse the new set of morals the intersection here is neither empty nor is it the original I'm wanting to Canada not get confused by is if the set of models were actually strictly inside in the knowledge base that would also be intersect it's neither Here nor There so if you knew as reindeers raining and someone said oh it's also snow into than something relationship between contradiction and helmer contradiction says that the knowledge base and Amar have 0 intersection entertainment this is equivalent to the knowledge base in TOWIE nada so just a simple proposition that says KB cartridge XF if if nf-kb and tails queso does the pictures you having here as egg not is all the models which are not in this in you think about Canada wrapping that around The Witness tree on notions entailment contradiction and contingency which are relationships between an orange face and new formula we can now go back to our anniversary assistant example and think about how to implement this operation if I have an address and I tell arm the virtual assistant particular formula app there are three possible what is which correspond to different appropriate responses I say it's raining then even the infinite element then I say I renew that if it's a contradiction then I should say I don't believe that because it's not consistent my night so far and otherwise you going somewhere there's also all the ass corporation which if you ask me a question again the same 3-inch almond contradiction and continuously pinhole responses are I should be answered this question so if it didn't tell me then I say yes and this is a strong yes insane oh yes is a definitely it is a contradiction then I say no it's a strong no it's impossible and then in other cases just concerned so the answer to a yes or no question three responses not to any questions about how many of your followers alright so this is all that aggression and it's going to connect to a patient that works you might be thinking your head well something like this already right now works we had these are complete assignments and we actually define joint distributions of her completely I know what we're talking about it Ahmad distributions but SAS and so we can actually think about the relation between a knowledge base I'm also having an ambition network land given by this formula remember a knowledge base is a set of models or possible worlds so in the problems that comes in invent on that event house some probably on that's that's a denominator and when you look at ass and KB and you in your sector you get some other event which is a subtle that and you can ask for the probability mass of introspective that's a new man divide the Ashley just gives you the probability of a Formula are given the knowledge so this is actually pretty nice and problematic generalization of the propositional logic all the all the Google something about yeah so the question is this only worth when restricted to the set of predefined positive symbols and ask about yeah you were in fact when you define problems in your logic you have to pre specify the set of symbols ceiling Indiana reading wasn't in the set of examples are you about yeah so the question is in the in the in practice you could imagine giving on it is raining or it's snowing and having normal con arm is it true that you can divide build systems and the system I'm showing you has a capability and this it'll be clear how we do that when we talk about in French because that allows you to operate directly on this syntax I'm here I'm talking or semantics you essentially just just going to be smarter but we're just defining the world this formula why is this Union not intersection so I'm Union heavy with a form which is equivalent to intersect in the models of give me away ok so this is a number between 0 and 1 and this reduces actually 2 the lodger case if this probability of 0 that means there's no contradiction maybe because this intersection 0 Anna B one Sammy's innocent Elmo arm and the coating is that instead of just saying I don't know you can actually give a probabilistic estimator well I don't know but it's probably like 9 so no we're not going to talk this is all I'm going to say about problems extensions the logic but there are a bunch of other thing on that you can do that can marry the expressive power of logic with some as well more about Skipper bloodiest assuming that yeah could do this you are assuming now we actually have the joint the problem is of course logic I'm only talking about inference I'm not going to talk there are ways to actually ok so back from the Depression now in no problem anymore we're just going to talk about there's another concept which is used for calls a satisfiability and this is going to allow us to implement arm Intel no contradiction contingency thinking of one on primitive the definition is a knowledge-based satisfiable the cellar Marlowes is Nana so it's not self-contradictory so now we can reduce asking tell to satisfy building remember ascotel have 3 possible outcomes if I ask a sales table question how many possible outcomes are there so am I going to make this protocol satisfiable so let's start with asking knowledge base uni I'm not s is satisfied so is it answer is no what can I remember the answer is no it's not survival which means Katie contradicts ladder what is that equivalent yeah it's not so it's which one of these is gnomon contradiction I'm interested in the relation between k bnf I'm asking a question about the Union model yeah yeah so exactly so there should be an angel relation between tbnr remember TV and tails f is equivalent to KB contradicting arm ok so what about if it's just then I can ask another question is KGB Union f satisfied the answer is no then it should be a contradiction because it says cable classic contradictive and then finally if it's yes then discontinued this is the way in which you can reduce Ansari asking tell which is basically about assessing internment contradiction are continuously to just too amostra satisfiability Huawei reducing things that satisfied propositional logics checking satisfiability is the classical problem is actually a special case of salt historian status I'm in the matter here is we just call propositional symbols variables I'm formulas constraints we can an assignment hearing we call Adam Harlow so in this case we have a knowledge base like this then there are three variables a BNC and we defined the csp and then we can find a satisfying assignment then arm then we return can't find one then I'm so this is called model checker it's called model checking because we're checking whether a model is exist is true so you are taking takes a knowledge base and outputs whether there is a satisfying model I'm there are bunch of algorithms here which are very popular something odpl named after for 4 people and this is essentially backtracking search Plus or pruning that takes into account the structure of your seat Witcher and others coming or WhatsApp which is even think about the closest analogue now we've seen as gifts what is a randomizer arm so just you really can have all the ingredients you are you need to do inference in proposition define what propositional logic symbols are formulas are I define the semantics and I've told you even how to solve internment and on contradiction contingency queries by reducing to say Billy which is actually something with more sequencing anyway arm trivia on coming back to the original motivation of x 1 + x 3 + 10 and how we're able to perform the Logical query much faster question how can we explain that a factor are are formulas rather than arbitrary and this is where in France Rose is gone ok so I'm so I'll try to explain this after a little bit since it was probably pretty mysterious open bikini so I have a butter formula this mum knows race overtime irecruit formula this phone has cobalt I'm a sad of model instamatic land and in this formula here if it's on a superset that means it's entail by these fun I know that this is cruel giving my knowledge which means that this is kind of logical consequence I want to know sofa we talked about this thing from that and doing everything over and Samantha I'm going to talk about now is inference rules that are agreeing to allow us to directly operate on the syntax hopefully some results ok so here is an example of making inference so if I say it is raining and I tell you if it's raining it's wet I'm raining players words then what should you be off their food sweat I'm going to write this into draw this way weather some 10 of the fraction looking like thing there's a set of premises which is a set of formula which I know to be true and if those things are true then I can derive I can clusion which is another fun nurses distance of a general raw card Morrisons are the sizes for any propositional symbols P and Q if I have p npm + qmi knowledgebase than I can garden tools cute so stock space Modus ponens talk about so nice here if I could do this having much last night because I is very local I know what I have to do is look at these three have to care about all the other formulas symbols that exist I'm going back to him this question over here about how do I what happens having new concept that occurred while you can just read everything is it just a new symbol there's not fixed out of symbols are you working ok so this example the infants roll in general idea of inference rules that you have Rosa say if I cf12 have k water formulas then I can add you Anarchy ideas I meant to be 4 is that in these inference rules operate directly on the syntax in not on giving a bunch of inference rules I have this kind of magic album baton do a logical inference as follows Remembrance Rose I'm just going to repeat until there's no changes to knowledge base I choose a set of formulas from the knowledge base if I find a matching raw inside rules exist when I simply add you to another so what the other definition I'm going to make it as this idea of the rides and proved so inference roar and drives proves arm so I'm going to write KB and now with a single or is on a line arm you mean that from this knowledge base given a cm and rose I can produce app the other this is in contrast Windhelm which is defined by the relationship between the models of KV and the mall as a bath now this is just a function of mechanically applying etc that's very very important distinction you think about it why is it called whenever you doing mathematical proof or some sort of Glasgow your incense in Samsung just doing LiveScore in France where are you have some premises and then you can apply some raw for example you can add x size of equation by 2 Adam raw you can quiet and you get some other equation which you would you help me ok so who is example just for fun I'll do it over so I can say it is raining in about dumpster gives me my knowledge base it has rain an it is raining it is wet I don't then I have this is the same as I'm rain and I sweat just in case you're on your propositional logic if I have employees that's the same as not p or q another said I have also wet a reminder because this in the background it's basically running forward in France 2 hire drivers Mini ok and if I say if it is wet it is slippery again no I have I have a Wenham place and I also derive slippery I'm I also derive rain I'm employed delivery which is actually Justine not drivable for Mottisfont and behind-the-scenes is actually much but the idea here is that you have your knowledge base you can pick up rain and rain plus 1 and angry can you pick up wet slippery new cards add with Modus ponens you can't actually drive somewhere can't arrive NatWest which is pomegranate because Newcastle Canterbury Rainham play Slippery which actually is true on modus ponens is not power so so the brain question you should have in your head is ok I'll talk about those two relations between analyse base Tiana formula app there isn't my relay this is really what you want because this is somatic meaning your to have this arcady derives which is the synthetic I'm relation what's a connection in general there is no connection butter these Concepts will help us think about the connection so it's cymatics these are things which are I'm when you look at messages you think about the models implied by the the formulas syntax is just some that someone yes 100 is real so to understand us imagine have a glass this class is what's inside a glass is a formula in particular it's of formulas which are true ok so this classes all formulas the this one realise entailed by so Darkness is a property of a set of Rules nss if I apply these rules until the end of time do I say within a glass my always going to generate formulas which are inside the glass which are somatic sound is good I'm completeness there's the canva are the Direction which says ad I am going to generate all the formula which are Orange am I generally extra stuff well at least I'll cover everything that's why I mean so the model you should have in your head as you want the truth the whole truth and nothing but tell me this is really bad nothing but the truth and completeness Isabelle the horse I do leave my both sometimes you can have both to you can't have to pick your battles but generally you might sound us you can maybe live without completeness bad if you're on sound that means you just going to generate erroneous conclusions which is where is it then maybe you just cat in person notions bottleless you the things are you doing for you know ok so how do we check on Souness so is more responding sound so remember rigorous way to do this the rigorous way is to look at two formulas rain rain what and then look at the model ok so rain corresponds to the set of model Siri rainer + what colour signs of this set and when I intersect them that's the set of models which are made by the knowledge base which is this corner here and I have to check whether that is a subset are the Marlowes of wet what is over here so this one one corner is subset of 1 and 0 so this remember this why is this subset nothing I want to check is that so just a definition ok sorry what's another example so if someone said it was wet and you know that Rainham play Sweat can you infer rain well lots of love so let's just double check it's ok so again what are models of wet their hair what is the morals of raining play Sweat they're here I get this on the C2 over here in.gr and then is that a subset of models of ring so this is on time general sounders is actually a fairly easy condition special in propositional logic bad in high rollers completeness is a different story which I I'm too really do or just as in this class my hero Academy example showing MotoSport answers incomplete so on for properties with land on so here we have the knowledge base ring or snow in plaits wet and is this until wet training I know it's raining or snowing then it should be wet Siri say yes yeah it should be until what is more respondents 0 well all the rows look like this so hula you can actually arrived at this with my response because this one is can reasonable or Arena snow racing simulator not wet is it tomorrow yeah because you're a no that's right sorry ok so this is incomplete so we can be you're sad about this are there two ways you can go to Texas the first way is we say ok ok propositional logic words to fancy question 10, 3 yeah so question is what is this mean this the knowledge bases of set off form in this particular formulation add remember the modes of an Irish painters where in the formulas are true yes in this case it does commits to rain being models of KBR only included the Moorlands where Brian is 1 otherwise is formal yep on the way back how can we have a probability of a model I'm so remember that a model is so remember I'm on here is just as I meant to say proposition symbols so when we talk about vision network where define distribution of loss so here what I'm saying is that assume there is some distributes over complete assignments to write a variable I can use that to compute I'm palavas Aquarius over form formula my archery switch off if you have two models that what formulas are on today then this intersection is orange so there is exists a sete let me do it you have this too and what additional work might a sign I'll probably point wine point on wine some distribution of early and if I have ring decor subsidies second right the probability of rain is 20 + 20 an if I have the probability of wet I'm giving ring and this is going to be the probability of the conjunction of the what is going to be worth airline which is here .5 divided by the probability of rain which is .7 cancel Vodafone is a sound but is not complete so there's two things we can do about this weekend either say propositional logic is too fancy fastest restricted sale at Motorpoint with respective restricted performance or we can use more powerful infants so today we're going to restrict propositional logic and to make a complete I'm in there next time we're going to show how a resolution which is even more powerful MP used to make any arbitrary this is what Arundel ok so humour definitions no working age define logic horn clauses so definite clause is an propositional formula of the following form so you have some profitable symbols or can join together and join us minutes and employees some other properties of simple and the intuition of the formula says if you want to be called k-hole them who also holds so here's some examples rain and snow in pies traffic traffic is is possible is a knot example this is a valid propositional logic formula but it's not a valid definite clause here is also another example rain and snow in place traffic or peaceful so this is not allowed because only thing allowed on a right side hand side the implication is a single propositional symbol in those two things over so one clause is um are definitely or a goal class which haemoglobin mysterious by Tom define as a arm something that you want APK in place Falls the way to think about this is an indication of a conjunction of because remember P and Q is not p or q this will be not or true which is not Esso so now we have this phone clauses on now remember the inference rule Motorsports hence we are going to slowly generalisers to include P&P ice cube ap150 came place so you get a match on on premises which include formulas which are atomic properties of symbols and the road looks like this and you I driver proof also is example when in retail if you see what weekday when we team plays traffic goes through formula then you can you're able to add ok so so here's the claim the Morriston is complete with respect to Horncastle for propositional so in other words what this means that suppose the nosebleeds contains only 1 classes and that on a sum internal or propositional or symbol I didn't tell proposition symbol I mean like KB actually entails please somatically then apply Motors ponens world arrive mean sad the two relations are equivalent and you can celebrate because you have both soundness and so just a quick example of this I'm so here imagine is your knowledge base and you're asking the question of is there traffic remember because this is a set of unequal classes and where is the nearest points which is complete arm helmet is the same as I'll be able to derive it using these rules this particular role I'm and you're doing in the following way so rain re-employ sweat gives you wet where's we day went and we doing place traffic is the traffic in London 2 migraine and BT wireless on the question is why Iranian we take phone classes so if you look at the definition what class is there definite clause look at the definite clauses he look like this I'm taking bs0 here which means that there's niskanen like nothing it allows look I'm using this annotation kind of that's gone ok stab if you have the end 01010 or you can just say by definition definitely presents contain problems ok so let me try to give you some intuition why modus ponens and 15 the way you can think about modus ponens is that in only works with positive information the result branching either or every time you see this you just definitively declare Tudor beech in your knowledge base you just going to build up all these puppies are symbols Noah going to be true and the only way you can add new prodigals symbol ever is by imagine I said of all the things which in Death Note to be true some road that tells you cute to be true and then you make you true I'm asked you to your knowledge bases the problem with provident awesome general causes if you look at this rain and snow and ice trafficker peaceful you can just write down traffic or peaceful what bottles are you have to reason about what I could be the one that I'm is outside the scope of my mother yep yeah yeah good good question so what happens if you would traffic and peaceful so this is a interesting case where a technically it's not a definite size but it's actually is an so there's a few solid his hair so you have am5 DNC you can rewrite at this is exactly the same as having two formulas a implies B and C in these are definitely causes I'm just like you you're technically if I give you a what about not A or B not a definite clause by the definition but you can rewrite that I'm a there is psycho you can extend verse to say not only definite clauses but all things which are morally right where you can do a little bit of rewriting and then you get home classy ok arm so resolution is this inference rule that will look a next time that allows us to deal with you ok so to wrap up so today we talked about logic so logic has three pieces we should use the syntax for propositional Logic 0 symbols which you string together into formulas in over and syntax layer visa given meaning by took him out and we introduce an idea of them a model which is a particular configuration of world that you can be in a formula denotes a set of models through under the formula is a given by an interpretation function then we looked at on Intel men's contradiction in contingency which are relations between a knowledge base and a new formula that you might pick up you can either do satisfiability check on monitor checking Astra size 5 ml salt or you can actually do things in syntax lamb by age are operating correctly I'm so that's all happy today and I'll see you next Monday
