this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development so today we're going to the Alps Rover with extended climbing abilities Switzerland autonomous mobile robot become a key technology unmanned planetary missions the cope with the rough terrain encountered on most of the planets of new locomotion Concepts for Rovers and microwave have to be developed an investigate in this video presenting innovative Offroad able to passively overcome unstructured what's a 2 times it's a wheel diameter using a rhombus configuration this Rover has 1 wheel mounted on a fork in the fridge one wheel in the rear and 2 bogies on each side here we can see the trajectory of the front wheel mounted on the fork an instantaneous centre of rotation situated under the wheel axis tell Paul to get on obstacles to ensure good adaptability of the boat it's necessary to set is lowest both simultaneously maintaining maximum ground clearance it's architect provides a non hypostatic configuration allowing the bum to adapt to passive turn the terrain profile motion in structured environments a it's necessary to have a good Coraline between body size and step dimensions we can see that the Rover is able to climb regular stairs effortlessly motion in an unstructured environment also made some outdoor tests on rocky terrain as can be seen arova demonstrates excellent stability on rough terrain advances despite a lateral or frontal inclination of 40 degrees and is able to overcome obstacles like rocks even with a single buggy in the next the robot will be with adequate sense for fully autonomous operation so it's quite interesting because when we think about wheeled robot we think about mobile platforms working in indoor environments and it's really difficult to imagine this machine is going around and being able to like vova app sticker so we usually try to use what do we use in an even terrain and what would be the solution for other service alternative Leggett so we always think legged locomotion would be the solution and the impact locomotion is very adapted to those problems because now you can move its leg and go over ups but in here we can see her away that you are infected putting the data compliance inside the structure and moving the structure as you are adapting to the employer so this is really a white Knight salute but there was also designed that combined leg locomotion together with wheels so you have a hybrid solution where Aur using the wheels and pushing with the legs so there are civil ways of even going further beyond it just a modifying the the chassis tell going to Adam proportion by the legs so you take this project was pursued further and I'm not sure if we will have more videos on on this one ok so let's go back two dynamics ndarray think today we will finish show that portion of the Alexa I think I emphasise Dynamics I also inside the phone Dad Dynamics is very very closely related to control and we really need to understand equation motion in order to be able to control well the robot so let's go back a little bit to what we saw on Monday about the Lagrange equations we saw that weekend describe the dynamic behaviour of the robot that is its motion it is it's as a function of the boat supply to the river through the slide range in equation that involves the kinetic energy and potential energy so gay is the kinetic energy and u is the potential energy and we saw that because our potential energy is only function of the configuration we can separate this equation and fine the structure related to the inertial force the forces applied through the robot that is the gravity and the talks which means that we can write the equation put the inertial forces on one side and then analyse the Dynamics that is the inertial forces they mama and then see the effect of those forces by 2 the sister that is external bored through the Motors at East drive to have a motor the motor is applying a torque at the joint or a force out of prismatic joint and also the effect of the gravity that are come so if we analyse this equation we saw that we can write it in this phone in the form a mass matrix multiplied by the acceleration at all the joints plus some additional forces that are function of the velocity and function of the fibre the mathematics is configuration dependent and those forces could be obtained if we expect our kinetic energy in quadratic form expression that is 1/2 cubed transfers function of the configuration cube this is a scalar and if you do the derivation of the scalar we find in fact that we have the situation that is this part will bring does element the mathematics of acceleration and this part which represent the centrifugal force and we can see from this expression that cube that is equal to 0 this will disappear if the mathematics was constant this will also disappear so we send the proof of this I think that you remember so in this form the equation now can be written in turn off the mathematics the derivative of the Mathematics and the velocity and the gravity forces equal to the applied torque because the mathematics is this correct form now we can if we are able to extract the kinetic energy from our analysis of the difference emotions of the link we should be able to find the mass matrix directly from the Connecticut then we put it there and because he is Sony function the mathematics under velocities we should be able to obtain V and that will give us the full equation simply by Computing the kinetic ok so that's what we're going to do we're going to do this analysis and find how we can find the mass and when we found the mathematics we will find and then she is ok so how are we going to proceed so here is an example of an arm and we are looking at one of the joint one of the links link I this is a rigidbody and this rigidbody has a mass distribution has come in Russia and has so what are you doing to do we're going to look add the kinetic energy associated with that specifically and ideas if we are able to describe and find the Skinner dick energy we will be able then to go over all the different lengths and do the sum and find a source of kinetic energy and because we have this relation we can put the two together and we can then identify the total kinetic energy from the individual kinetic energy so 4-link I the total kinetic energy is going to be the sun of the different kinetic energy so link I will be here and when you walk through all the links we are going to find different kinetic energy is that we can some and find the total kinetic energy but then we will say the kinetic energy of the system should be expressed as a quadratic form on the Jazz velocities and the question is how can we do identification and extract them so you see that I'll get it on just doing this part and then identifying and from that song so I'm sure half of you remember the kinetic energy and Rotherham what's not remember so how would you find the kinetic energy will save you for remember so how is it where the actress and we never to some velocity V what is the kinetic yes yeah but what does that represent I think I could you repeat it clearly so remove the speaker 02 it's current state the definition so it's the work done by the external Force to bring the system to Estate from West and that nimes we are going to take a look at this find Mars and its final velocity V and that will go come to be 1/2 and be square now this is for appointment if you are working with links ent links are Richard Archer and they have rotational motion and which musician of the particle is moving at different velocity etc and there is a a quantity that allow us to evaluate that initial forces generated by this party and this is the nurse so that the rigid object is going to intervene now if we look at rotational modes so the kinetic energy associated with additional body who's in Ayrshire is ICC the inertia computed with respect to the centre of mass as we have everything is represented at the centre of mass this rigid object from first 0 kinetic energy when we reach Omega the lady some kinetic energy and its kinetic energy is going to be just when degree of freedom this would be basically I asked you earlier I representing the inertia about that access Omega Square but we are looking here at a spatial motion so I is a matrix and Omega is a vector so we need to write it in this ok so if we take this rigid body and together V and Omega that is it is undergoing both angular motion or rotational motion plus linear motion then the door combined and the total kinetic energy will be the sum of these two ok will clear about this is very important what she has to the kinetic energy you have all the dinner the rest is just just Matt base so you understand this 41 then we're going to be ready we just tried this alright no Theatre from here I'm going to find dynamic equation a multi-body articulated sister directly buy something this kkh if you understand this you will see imagery that is going to emerge this mathematics for all the structure so can I take another sip of one link is this combining the kinetic energy associated with linear motion and the kinetic energy associated with England and let's do the song so the total kinetic energy is the sun and I'm going to write just to remind you we have selected for this structure we selected a set of glass for dinner and that means we have a set generalized velocity scooters so these are the minimal number parameters of configuration parameters needed to represent the disk configuration one sku is defined the configuration is locked right so now we can say because we know business coordinator Janice velocities we can say the kinetic energy is also this expression of half cube transfers and Q we're in is positive definite symmetric positive definite Matrix that appears in this quadratic form so we have this too the simplest the first one is here we are saying we can compute individually the kinetic energy sweetheart worrying about the connections the constraints yeah I'm just going and looking at every link and evaluating its kinetic energy and the doctor said she's going to be the song without even thinking about what type of joint now you're saying if if we write the expression as a function of the generous velocities we have physics and the two are equal it's the same kinetic energy are you still following here good and this is the key now we are going to identify this expression with the sum of thing by the individual legs ent somehow we are going to like work little bit to come up with liftmaster ok so no help me what is needed in here in order to to extract m and find its expression jacobian translate the last so in the left-hand side we have half and here we have right in the left-hand side we have Cuba transfers Cuba around the edge India we have the CI the linear velocity at the centre of mass of each of the link the angular velocity at each of the links so what you are saying is we need some how to Express this vci and Omega eyes as a function of kudos and if we do that then we can say we can put it in an expression similar to this and extract is that a good way you all agree should we do it doughnut you have it in your hands but let's do it ok so doodle we are going to use the jacobian and what we need to do is somehow to come up with a jacobian this is not the same the cover you talked about before that is if we look at what we developed before we develop as recovering odysseum remember at the last link we had a jacobian that allows to compute the linear and angular velocities at this point and this world called what does jacobian anyone remembers before the m Davy which is the jacobian associated linear motion and GT omega omega associated with England so but this was the fine here at the end effector and this was velocity responding to the velocity generated by all the cute all the cube that's right but what I'm talking about the linear and angular velocities at this point so it's not going to be this vci is depended on which velocity Cubitt wine Tudor 22 Q dot I meant this one or I will not sure you see what we are at the vc.ru should the centre of mass of the link so PewDiePie is just before so it is dependent on aptitude at alright so I want to find out later but essentially we need to come up with a jacobian that will capture all these queues because I need the queue that again I don't want us to go from cute that one took you that I I need to be able to write this Matrix so that I can x cute so we will be fine jvi in a bit that we need a metric pilots yeah Green what about omega well Omega is going to be in the same form we will have another metrics we call it J omega this is different from JV and J omega when we say JV and Omega we mean the jacobian associated with the end of fact when we put the eye it is really related to the velocity and that specific ok alright now let's go and plug this in this equation so now you substitute vci with jvi Cuba and the transfers of that so what is the transpose vci transpose with b cure Cuba transfers JV CI transport so when you do this you're going to have the transfers of Cuba Tahir djvi and the jbi coming from the DCI and the same thing for The Omen alright we're almost there you're going to see the Mathematics and merging someone can help with the next step Ronald actually some of you already see what is m vets that so what do we need to do so we notice this I we have an eye here we have this eyes but this diskuze are independent of the sun so we can take them outside and that's it you see the jacobian in the mathematics do you see the mathematics um it is quite amazing your mathematics is simply jacobian transpose jacobian scaled by your master that's it so all that this mathematics is just to take did you call me an associated with both specific points of the centre of mass and see the impact on the velocity because they are capturing the fact of the Velo and you are scaring them my mi or ICI so if you're over 12 one degree of freedom so I will be one basically this would be anyone and jvj V1 transfers jb1 and that will be the inner shelf that first link now if you have multiple Lines what you can see is you can see that the jacobian Matrix of all of these things are going to contribute so you can think about this as the sum of M1 M2 M3 and m and you can see the impact each of the links on the total maths so we will take an example Al but you can see how each of those links is going to affect the matter and as we propagate and move from Langley to the new we are capturing the initial property coming from the lower joints and moving down to the end so that is your Mathematics and now the rest is really competition just getting this we've actor from the partial derivatives of the by the way I still having define what is jvi it is I said this is a jacobian associated with that centre of now and I think we need to be fine more carefully so in order to be able to CAPTCHA jvi at the centre of maths we end an explicit as a hundred of all the queues what we going to do is we going to take this vector locating the centre of mass and taking its partial derivatives up to the point QI so this is column I and every column after that will be sure to by definition this metrics the jacobian Matrix computed with vector PCI and after this point and then we are adding both 0 columns ok so what about Jay omega what would be J omega without looking at your nuts J Omega used to be what Epsilon I bar Z 1 Epsilon toolbar so we will do the same thing app 20 and we add zeros column ok so now United definition of jvi omega and now you can compute this you already have the DH parameters for Staffordshire man on it's computer mouse mat you have done no well it will take more than 10 minutes I'm sure so I was taking an example of 2 degrees of freedom in fact before even going to the example list song let's do something something just at the analysis of this mathematics we talk about so I'm not sure if you will really see what is in here bed when you think about this mathematics as I said it is so so stuff like so much positive definite and it has a lot of properties and you can connect this properties to the structure of the road so festival at sea M11 represent N11 so I have a robot I'm going to use my arm to illustrated if you can this is the first truck rotation about the sax embassies the second shot ok 13 goodbye so could you tell me what the M11 represent so let's take this minute later on it is one link the whole thing Queen I'm going to repeat about the sax play 80 there is an acceleration basically inertia time acceleration equal to talk right in that case 1 Degrees like a pendulum the notion of the pencil so so that in a shelter pendulum is captured where in this matter can you see it no not yet it is N11 N11 is representing the Senate now vicinity is function of what the consideration so if I change this configuration library I'm going to change the value of M11 I move like this it is lighter have ok ok mt2 the same question it represents what oh come on we did anyone Wednesday M22 if he if we lack all the joints after into a mean after joining two entity represent what inertia perceived are joined to so all these diagonal element are representing the inertia received the Factor finish opposite art of the chance ok let's go to Eminem a wake-up plumbing mmm is this last link so this is representing the inertia perceived about this axe right it's function of wet what is Lincoln and it is not fair really my head is just a constant link it's David but it cannot move so mnm is representing that perceived innit and it's functions which variable I'm sorry it is the last joint coordinates ok everyone agrees with him OK Google full address please for your hair 12 you are in Minority Democrats take over it's not career actually in this case it's really the law physics that are going to play and the law physics if I'm moving when link about some axis so it is the case of this link everything is that and that is could you tell if it's something of anything except the weight and the inertia mass distribution on the link so so mm should be cost it's not functioning The Cure but thank you for for just making the point to make sure that we we emphasize mnm is not function of the lost thing at last joint it is cast now the question to you video Star the prettiest joint right let's bring this one so you can see that covers just the inertia is going to be spent on the so MN east coast the previous joint will depend on the next one and as we move we cm22 is function of what N22 is going to be functions of the joint that are following so the robot if we think about anyone one is M11 functions of joint one no N11 1gn the dependent on the configuration of joined one ever q1 is the initiative depends only on how we displaying this track so the following jobs everyone sees this good anyone is function of what independent of the first shot because as a Moses around if I fix all the other joint and I know about this I'm not changing the initial about the sex but it's function of all the following jobs so my 11 is function of what cuter 2QN N22 is function of Q3 too cute and the last one is cast ok there are a lot of interesting properties about this what is the relationship between M12 and N21 pedantic cemetery if if you have a robot one degree of freedom robot nnn and you model the mathematics of that and then you took it to another structure well when you find the total mass properties of that structure the mnm is exactly the same that you computed for that so if I take if I take note structure wave join 2 to join 10 with it's nice property I found the mathematics of that robot and now I attach the server to an additional charge look what happened Indian numismatic you will find the same block the same matrix is completely inserted here and what you are adding now you are adding the mathematics the most properties perceive by this joy but indicating you are creating top link you are creating this couple between the first joint and each the Giants of the structure you are ready so M12 M12 is representing the coupling between the acceleration of Jointer Andre Antoine N21 is the opposite joint one on trying to think about this if you multiply this Matrix by you double that qw it will BN11 cube double that 1 + N1 2QW 2 all of this is going equal to Tokyo so the first equation is the Dynamics of the first join and that been a mix of the first joint if you try to imagine what that equation will be it will be M11 cubed is that one plus all this coupling accelerate ecotalk one so when you have just joined you have anyone want to be that one no acceleration is here but as soon as you relax the lock and leave it away as you stop moving this is going to produce coupling Force you see that ok what does it mean that m is positive definite the answer be greater than 0 and less cute very good so that is physically you can Park about an object with 0 right so the object has to have a mass and that is always bothered right if you have a particle of with some mass it is always puzzle now when we go to articulated body systems the same prop but it is in a mattress firm and this end has to be positive all the time whatever so if you think about the kinetic energy it's 1/2 Cuba transfers in Cuba well the kinetic energies always positive right other if we are at rest if we are at the cubits are there so the quantity K1 have to the transpose in cute up is going to be positive 0 only if you that equals discuss the matter I'm going to simplify the problem and we're going to analyse it with Sudocrem I think that will make it a little easier computer is it because what we need to do is now little bit competition using Lagrange equations going to those vectors we computed and that kudos - big letter old is competitions um1 forever and then you know the structure and then better but I want you to understanding where those questions are coming France are you going to analyse it on ok so this is a two degree of freedom manipulator and now I'm writing equations for 2 degrees of heat so you can see here what is the first equation could someone read the first question for me you have two questions right this is one of my question that you could write into a question so could someone read the first equation equation 1 presenter the Dynamics of the first link the second equation represented enemies of the second leg if we walk the first the second M11 qw1 plus V oneplus G101 if the second one is moving there is coupling coming from gw2 on the first one and the opposite is on so what I'm going to do is to compute with you ok we going to compute the V1 and V2 and we are going to do this by going to by going to the equation V this is the scary poison but don't worry all there if you remember when we did the the competition the kinetic the derivative of the kinetic energy which came up with the equal end - visit remember that right everyone remember so basically he is is simply end up cubed - 1/2 the first element is cubic transport mq-1 and mq-2 what does it mean in q1 well mq1 is means that this is the Matrix the mathematics all the elements of that mattress I'll taken ASDA ready for this factor q1 and the second one with respect to cute so I'm writing this situation here in more explicit way I'm saying 80s what so what is in that it is the derivative of the element of the metrics right you agree with this and what is mq11 is the partial derivative of M11 respect to q1 M12 respectacle one basically the Matrix with respect to q1 so I'm writing in 11 35 of 1121 ok and here with respect to how do you see this location basically the mutation is saying the element 11 is taking here partial derivative with respect to 2 or 1 depending on the viable the last element ok so we just talked about we now for the time derivative of M11 we will write it in This Way We Live the time of M11 is the parcel delivered back to 1 qubit 1 and the partial derivative with respect to 22.2 you're ugly this order the only valuable that are involved in in the queue I'm just expressing expending little the disagree right ok so this is just writing the coaching and now we are going to this is little bit more about what is 111 it is partial derivative of M11 with respect to q partial derivative with respect to q so little like this and if we go further and develop this competition and write it so this is how is cats if we write the vector we can develop it as the sum of these two terms so I mean from the top you can see that the vector is involving velocity the product of velocity school that won X Factor so it will be resolved into product of velocity cubed one square to the two square and cubed to 1 cubed and we are dropping all of these in this phone so this is the answer I am just doing it her saving time you don't have to do it this is the answer what is v is as a function of notes partial derivatives and velocity ok do you accept that I mean you you can do it but basically you can in fact you you might be surprised why I'm writing Plus in 1 to 1 - 10 1 2 1 writing there 11-plus 119 11 it is really interesting for what is Tinder is that under this phone did is some pattern that is taking place and if we look at this expression this expression has a pattern that is repeated all the way and where are you going to end degrees of freedom we find the spartan over again it's ok mij k with pigmentation first element Plus - and there is a presentation involving the three so this expression is going to help us find finding does mattresses that H are going to scale velocities the positive that is if we think about 2 degrees of freedom we have square of the velocity square of the second velocity and product of the two but if you go to lie six degrees of freedom you have the square of all the velocities in mini product of velocity cubed 13.2.1 to the 326 and you have all of the so we can always put them in turn metrics x velocity squared of the velocities and metrics x the product of philosophy and always involving us elements anyone knows what this represents well Sir Christopher discovered this pattern and We Go Round the Christopher symbol the b i j k that we can form from combining the presentation the partial derivatives of mij so you start with element MIG and you take its partial derivative and the new forms symbols ABI JK is one the element mi ij taken with respect to k and then I K taken with respect to Jay - JK taking with this well so this is the first element and using this symbols we can simplify the writing of what we saw here these two mattresses and write them in this phone so you have a m x x the square of the velocity and another matrix x cooling mattress in this case x the product of Alexa when we go further this will generalized and this matrix is function of cubic audit-c this is the centrifugal horse mattress because this matrix is multiplied by the square of the velocity and be is the coronavirus mattress and this matrix is multiplied by the product of and this generation this way 4 and degrees of freedom so the 10th of April first Netflix is this Natalie when was the prize by the square of the velocity is give you the centrifugal force and the coronavirus first mate when was the pride by the product of velocities give gifts you the vector bq.com symbolic we put it this way this will give you the song coronavirus so the cinematics centrifugal Force majeure has to be of dimension w how many Square velocities we have shut up how many qubits do we have in so how many how many squares we have end Square velocity so this mattress will be an n by n m ok this Matrix b how many cubic cubic how many product of velocity beside the square well it allowed to have n - 1 x 10 / 2 basically I call him so for six degrees of freedom this is what 5 x 6 / 2 wishes 15 so if you go from 12 to 16 and then to 3 to the end you have a loan a product of velocity how many roles we have here did the nation of the is always going to be 6 Oren so we will have always anyway so you have more columns how many columns this is the 15 columns for 6 degrees F why is m X Factor to produce Force the Coronas vs RB x 2.0 Annecy Elsa has in the world but it's a square match ok so we can come to the recently bye finding the bees and these are simply functions of the partial derivatives of the element of and Lansbury computed and we just do this differentiation and do the competition recent was very simple if you're not doing it by hand but if you're doing it by hand It's Complicated lipstick and example in in 2-minutes and you'll see it's not that difficult for few degrees of freedom and you get the sense of it ok you get ready on here the main idea is to remember and gives you V and V is obtained by do mattresses c&b and these mattresses are involving element that all the partial derivative of a fan and that's why it is constant everything here is there so if the mathematics was constantly is no centrifugal toilet one more think left is the gravity I mentioned the gravity and we need to deal with the gravity song how do we compute the gravity you have you have you shoveling somewhere and you have the centre of mass right ent and as you move up and down you have different potential energy right hiya better so you hide is really important and you can compute the height so I didn't computer professional energy your specific link and then you add them together so the potential energy for the computer guy you have a Victor we ever deformed this voucher locating the centre of mass we have the heart we have the gravity pointing South so we didn't - gravity factory x the PCI product recall stage and that gives you mi now what is the gravity force as well it is just the gradient of the you just take her the partial derivative with respect to q and you find it and what is the partial derivative gives you usually gives you the columns of the jacobian so it's actually your gravity is simply this - * the JV eyes X Factor in 1 M2 2 mm actually a very simple way to think about it is lips let's look at it this way you have this money later you have all these links and you have the centre of mass if you are standing I this it's almost like you are at East of Village you have a first thing you do and you are trying to compute the total responding to that first so what is the force pulling down this is the maths of that particular joint * the Great right everywhere like this wait so what is the token responding to this solicitor for the last one f what is the torque tokiko J Transport so Jade transfers in this case Vienna f wishes MMG just add them all together and how I know you have your gravity ok so now we know the gravity we know how to compute today let's take an example ok this is so do you see this robot little Victor can you see it so I didn't hear through them robot and the first joker is revolut what happened to your voice command the second joint is oh yeah that's better so however it does nothing the simplify to really know what we are doing is we are selecting we are selecting this point and representing the interfactor on this point service D2 is measured from here to here ok and we are not putting it in here the update at the centre of and we are looking at apparently that has a mass of M1 a second link of empty and initial density of ice one at the centre of mass and ic2 we are locating the deflector bc1 by The Sister from the origin and the origin located here at the axis so it's one why why and you have 01 so could you find the dynamic equations of this road how to proceed how are you going to do what is the mathematical yes first one with the 1st start from now on I want to say the mass of the sun x so I mean we found the mass matrix is the sum from I = 21 2 NM I JV I transpose jvi plus Omega so we can just take that expression and just tried it ok you didn't just up from the end from musically you need to computer ok do you agree with this and then this is what we we we we established so list of bakeries so what do we need to do in this situation what is missing we need to computer JV ice and J omega right how do we compute AVI we need PCI the vector locating the centre of mass New Zealand vector well it is there you have to be careful how you you write it the BBC when is di green I want to sign one and everyone sign one you're ugly if anyone doesn't agree please make sure sometimes it takes a there is no minus is everyone ok now once you have received after you do the parcel delivered this and you compute you're jovian alright the 1st jacobian jb1 we computer up to 1 to the first column and add a 0 car the second one we compute actor Colin to basically all of them and now we went to make find expression M1 jv1 transfers jb1 so you get these two expressions the first element this 2 by 2 m and the second element is that so the mathematics is equal to the sum of those four elements the first element is this we have 30 and justice so nice one the contribution of mass 1 to the total mass matrix appears here what is this if everything was 0 this is telling you that the centre of mass of mass one x it's distance to the axis gives you some inertia and this is the contribution of the centre of mass 12 the mass m understand that and that make sense master contribution is joint one and it's contribution is appearing the distance square of knots centre of mass to the axis in Excel master has another contribution on the second job ok so you see how this is this is added you start with 1 element mass one and you'll see it's contribution last one will never appear anymore master is going to appear here and here and in different robots is what appears also in here in the cup but as it happened because of physical it's not going to happen here anymore Dennis weather Z1 and Z2 we are going to have the jacobins here are the two jacobian and when we do the multiplication we see contribution the inertia of Blink-182 only Android one the contribution of inertia on Gentoo appears only Android because joint 2 is Plas Madoc so the total mathematics is here the mathematics as it happened for this robot is the couple there is no they are of the Reagan doctrine you can see that M2 is appearing here M2 is constant as we said M2 is representing the inertial properties of you along axis 2 that is what if you work joined one you are moving a mass UC that's all what you see right ok let's lock join two and look at joint one when you rotate about joined one you're going to see the inertia of joined link 1 and link 2 you're going to see the distance of the centre of mass by the skills by the mass of 1 and 2 ok this yes like the term ml Square looks like it is inertia of the centre of of March when when you are looking at the linear motion and then you have the England motion bringing all the rest of the contribution of the initial prop you have both of them the mass in one which represent the mass of the link at the centre of Mars another word for contribution inertial Force by the square that has to be I mean to be a homogeneous in units are you basically need distance so you have M1 L2 plus all the rest of the contribution of the inertia of the link because it is a rigid body and we computed its inertia the next question is what about how this is very as we move into as we extend the location of M2 this is function the disc you see that so it's fine we don't have much time but I think we can do the centrifugal coriolis forces so you need to compute bij case alright so I said it is simple and I didn't say why it is really simple because there are a lot of things that just disappear what about this mij case what what things you you you would remember from what we said we said something about the like element mnm is independent of any viral N22 is function of N22 is functions of the configuration soap if you take the parcel delivered it off M22 with respect to point one you're going to have 0.2 Zara it's function of 34 and underlay so many of those elements like if I take IG with respect to IKEA larger then I then it's going to be 0 and that Leeds to properties that old bis r0 all the di Ji r04 a crater of and in our about the only variable just anyone the only element that is changing so with M11 we have only to consider b it is delivered with a Spectre 2 that means that we have only m112 that is non-zero and m112 is simply the element was m2 to square so it will be 2 m to the two and when we write the mattresses that appears like the so it appears in the Beamer tricks and it appears in the symmetry so there are indeed centrifugal forces that will appear the Matrix VR Paris like this could you tell me where the centrifugal forces are appearing which joint is going to have to see the effect of centrifugal force join two because you can see here you have stated that to x this and this goes to read to you see that which joint will have coronavirus was joined louder joined can you you multiply this by the top it goes to the wall Sevilla has a CV joint one has the Coronas enjoying to has a centipede and it's really easier if you're approved you see that interval was will start going away and that is joined to Santa Fe and the first one is the product of velocities coriolis ok so the vector is drivers the gravity factories already there because we already know jv1 and jv2 just your computer be careful on your gravity vector it is writing down long with minus y Direct this is your vector so when we are in this configuration the centre of mass 1 and 2 adverbe distances will produce a force rejected with the cosine and the on the joint or we have only M2 that is affecting the car and finally here is your mum wow I'm time ok now we can use next time see you on Monday
