this presentation is delivered by the Stanford centre for professional development ok let's get started so as always the lecture starts with video segment and today's video segment comes from 1991 and from the group at the British Columbia deals with b walking so there should be some sound British butterfly new motors airport well maybe we need some orders ok so today we're going to start to covering kinematic and can you mix as I mentioned last time can you make it is very very important the models that describe the robot position the robot frame and links and joints we going to go over the basics in the Script describing a task the model that we can use to determine the position and orientation of the factor then obviously when we determine the location of a link we need to be able to transform that description to the next king or to describe the position and orientation of the end effector in a previously so we need really to Handel transformations then we need to discuss how we represent the position and orientation there are many different ways through which we can describe a position or an orientation and we will discuss fuel different representations 
 I'm going outside to describe little bit what is a manipulator what is a robot arm and then what all this joints with all the degrees of freedom of a manipulator how we count represent the position of Emmanuel how many bellator is define by a set of links connected through joints the first one the first of those thing is We Gonna Do bass and the last one is actually the Script the whole purpose of the manipulator is really to move this gripper play set in space to-do manipal obviously later with we will see that it is possible to use the buddy the links themselves to do manipulation recall it already manipulation but for now we are really interested in locating this end of factor at the same time locating any other links that is movie so we will see that there are two types of joints that we are going to consider there will be other possible type types of joint we can see that any set of joints could be reduced to those two type of join the revolute joint and prismatic joint allows you to rotate about a fixed axis and is matting joint allows you to translate about a fixer and this motion is done along or about 1 access so it is one degree of freedom motion so as I said we have linked endless slings are a number of and we're going to call n is the number of moving legs Plus one base link the fix link we have joined off too tight revolut joint and prismatic so the idea is we are going to work with one degree of freedom and this is interesting because knowing that we have only one degree of freedom joint then we will be able to connect a DS to the generous coordinates as we will see and as I said if we have a joint like a spherical joint would you know how many degrees of freedom as physical joint would have so what do we do is we will then use 3 of joints with 0 links length and then we will introduce these joints and links to represent a now we have this money for later in this configuration and the question is how can we represent the configuration of the money what would be a good way to represent the configuration because we need to know where the manipulator is in with respect to affix so well I mean there are many different ways we can go to East link and try to to fix that thing so we can take a baby I given link and say we're going to locate this linked with several that's like it there so if we was like 3 vectors and 3 different the link is defined and that would give us the configuration of that thing now we are going to use in that case free vector is vector has 3 parameters in 3D so we have 9 parameters to describe each link and we have n-linked moving legs so we will need 9 mm a lot of promise and this is this would be one of the representation so the description of the position using a set of configuration parameters can involve a large number of and each of them is fine so any set of parameters that describe fully the configuration is called a set configuration parameter so in this case here we have 9 parameters porting now we are really interested in a particular set of parameters configuration parameters has minimal number of parameters in we don't need all these parameters in there 3 factors 3 points because the point are fixed so there is a constraints between this phone that is going to show us that these three factors are not independent in fact we will see that we will be able to describe the configuration of the with much less piranha so that brings us to Janice Gordon so as it is essentially a set of configuration parameters brings parameters that are completely working with Source Code in it is very interesting because you can use them to find the Dynamics later as we will see we can use them we can count them and the number of tonight's coordinates gives you directly the number of degrees of freedom of Europe so Alexa analyse how many parameter are you with me to describe the configuration of a manipulator with a set of genus called so we have this money Plater connected through joined and in order to count how many degrees of freedom we have what I'm going to do I'm going to remove the job so let's remove this job now you have n rigid body in space right if we take one of those Richard but this one of the link how many parameters you need to describe the position and orientation 34000 positions 34000 orientation so with 6 parameters we have a description off 1 rigid body now we have any moving rigidbody in total we need 6 a.m. now let's think about those constraints introduced by the joints if we put back the joints we are going to introduce constraints now a joint has Wendy Green right we said one debate so how many concerts the placement of a joint is going to introduce is giant will introduce how many constraints 5 because it is going to allow only one degree of freedom so if we think about the number of constraints we will see that we will have five constraints for joint and that leads to 5n constraint case train set what's the weather Orange play let's look at it so if we have I joined it's going to introduce constraints on the rotations and a the position so if we play Sara blue joint it's not going to allow any displaced and it's not going to allow rotations about orthogonal access to the axis of rotation so that's 5 points trains three positions constraints and rotation in the case of prismatic a prismatic joint it's not going to allow any rotation just translating and translating about one access to the two other access orally doesn't matter still fight so now let's do the council we said we 6n parameters before placing the join and now we place the giants and we have five and constraints the question to you how many degrees of freedom it is going to be it is going going to be the difference right so 6EN miners 5n the answer is so indeed we have just ended visa free which is really nice if we have one degree of freedom joint in a manipulator in a robe weekend we can be sure that we are going to have any degrees of freedom the number of John now I'm talking about a manipulator with 6 bits if I take a humanoid robot and I do the same thing at a given configuration if we like one of the feet of the humanoid robot this is correct but I want to draw but can move so in that case the base is moving and the bass house six degrees of so it will be end Plus 6 unfortunately those lost six degrees of freedom of the base or not actually there are numerous and that's What Makes the control of humanoid robots very hot however in the case of how many ml is the basis fixed we have individual freedom 4EN jointed robot ok clear ok so let's go to the end of factory benefactor is this last rigidbody in the system so it has all the freedom give before the position and oriented and affect so we can think about a point at the end effector that we are located and we can think also by the orientation of the indus Howie oriental doesn't affect her so there is a lots of frame attached to the infected rotating with it that other words to describe the position and orientation of the engine so if we have just one end effector in the robot essentially we have just one of these at most we need depending on the Freedom because some some robots can only move in the plane from Roblox can move with the restricted rotation orientations or position so Atmos we doing to have six degrees of freedom for the end of fact but again we can represent that freedom of the end effector that is the configuration of the end effector with many different so we can park also about configuration parameters for the end of factory and we can see that some of those parameters can be defended and when they are independent they form a set of July school dinners and then we can have a description of the end of factory using a set of tennis court in its passcode Denise or what we call an operation on kodi so if they are just configuration parameters without the condition of Independence then we can talk about this and parameters describing the position and orientation of the end of so this is the definition that is we have a set of parameters describing the position and orientation with respect to a fixed frame Betsy give me an example an example of set of parameters that describe the position and orientation of rigid body and affect so to describe the position and orientation of rigid body this is original play The Salvation I would like to describe the position and orientation with respect to this yeah ok you use three angles play 4 years free angle sorefix angles we can find this position orientation for the and for the position so we can take a vector and locate 1.6 Sport so with one Factor free angles we can describe the position and orientation of 6 km are you talking about how a giant introducer 5 constraints honorific baby and instead of imagine the days imagine the next rigid body was free completely to move and now I put a joint and now it has only wonderful freezing so so here we have a very nice example of representation that is minimal represent anyone can give me a representation that is not minimum select three free vectors are three different points that will be 94 that would be a set of configuration when we will see also the have you heard about the other parameters how many of them you have so Tottenham score what was the reason we will we will see later that when we use we have a pub we have a problem a tracking this rotation continuously there are configuration where the representation singular and we need a different set of parameter really to keep track of the orientation and we introduce have you heard about the direction cosine vaguely ok you heard about the rotation matrix we going to see this in few minutes but you heard about rotation so you have a friend have a phone and you're looking at the relationship between the two well the rotation matrix if you take this rotation matrix between two friends so the description of this frame with his back to a fixed frame essentially if you take this matrix wishes three columns free vector so it's 9 km well if you that mattress distributors this three factors form the so-called Direction process of the this frame with this like this and we can use directly that matrix that description so we will have 9 for Ahmed Wallingford station the position free parameters will end up with 12 forum describing then perfect and we will see why we will go that way or why we go to other parameters and we will examine those singularities of the present particular setup kodi now that we're interested in is this set of independent coding we call them operational coding auto Skoda essentially there we are looking at the operational point where the rabbit is acting where we find attack the doors could be if I'm going to grass the talk is somewhere in the middle between the two doors as I move this is the point and controlling if I have a toll the top will be here and operational point with move depending on where I'm going to do the the so this is the first definition is operational point so you have 3 degrees of freedom and then you are Three Degrees of the angles the 3 anger to form a set of independent parameters and that gives you a set tonight's coordinates or operational kodi so this number it said before you remember it was and if it was not independent when it is independent we call it and Zara define dad vs independent set up alarm address and that gives us again the number of degrees of freedom of the end of so an end effector of a robot with 6 degrees of freedom moving in the three-dimensional space factory sell can be positioned anywhere and oriented anywhere so it has six degrees of freedom and that is the most number of degrees of freedom it can now if we if we go to the plane if we have an object is moving just into plane how many degrees of freedom you expect Portland affect my plane smoothing only in the planes cannot go out of this place for for the position how many winners interplay X and Y and for the orientation one only one top tip have a planar robot then we will be backing about Enzo = 3 and you have different robots with different characteristics enter to gives um3 that is equal to 4 or 5 but at most you have 41 
 now define operations coordinator so Tesco dinners with the find joint coordinates and here is an example if we take her a plane or robot so just 3 revolute joint Peter 1 Peter 2 seater 3 and this robot is moving in the plane so we have we have South African tayshan of vagina sofa here you have for you don't know 80 degrees 45 degrees in 50 degrees representing this configuration of the of the manipulator when away to think about it is to go and represent this 1-minute later as a point in a three-dimensional space and that's basically stator 1 Peter 2 cedar tree and that would be the joint space where this point say that which is the Victor take that one feature 2003 represents the configuration of this money for later so we called this the joint space or the configurations and this place a very important role in Motion we talk about configuration space and we talked about planning motions in configuration space supplying the motion of data and we talked also about all this articles that we have in this space in the physical space that we must that space lesbian configuration space obstacles or see obstacles not represent the howl obstacle in the real world are not today Astra configurations and then we can do the planning around the now Ford engine factory we as I said we'll ok then two Factor without Factor X Y define completely the position and orientation of the defector we need also the define orientation or some so we need Alpha and then x y and alpha represent fully the position and orientation of the end effector and that defines of the 3 coordinates operational coordinates for the interfactor obviously we have without a space operational space which is now the combination of why for this example and orientation Alpha event Factor and that is upon so the robot is reduced to appoint data in configuration space and its end effector is reduced to appoint XY Alpha the operations and that represents the manipulator and endo now these two spaces so the first space is fully describing the configuration of the robot but imagine but we have one more join on this road the end effector is fixed but the robot configuration can vary because of the redundancy we introduced by adding one more join so redundancy in this example hearing can see we have for joint and then the factors still has 3 degrees of freedom so for the same configuration you have different possible configuration of the structure of the links and that means we have redundancy so we talk about redundancy and we call the robot redundant if the number of degrees of freedom of the robot n is greater than the number of degrees of freedom of the end of Factor and 0 so if we haven't situation and 0 here is equal to 3 and n = 24 then the robot is said to be redundant and redundancy is very important in order to read and have accessibility you cannot just work with the motion of the robot with 3 degrees of freedom in the plane you going to hit upset so when you have redundancy that helps you to move around obstacles and position the robot in different configurations and we measure the degree of redundancy by the difference and m0 ok is Ashley wood not going to really discuss redundancy which is very important but we're going to the focus on non-redundant robots in fact in spring we will cover extensively redundancy we will start about the use of redundancy to control the robot may make use of the mechanical advantage the dynamic reduction that is introduced by redundancy and also the motion planning in collision avoidance using redundancy and how we combine and control redundancy in a way that would allow us to achieve a task while redundancy is maintained to achieve different materials and different so redundancy will not come back to it in internet robotics but it is very important that you need to at least now about intimacy definition what you going to do with going to go to the basics now and we going to start by building the models that would lead to the four Academy I'm going to start with the simple definition of a vector that is defining a point in space and we are going to go from there to building the models for representing an object in space which requires position and orientation and then we connect to this objects but before that we will talk a little bit about representation North different parameters I mentioned earlier so we will talk about 4:00 we will talk about it Angela and Direction cosines and probably this week we will cover all of that we will cover transformation how we move between frames and we will be ready next week to build the fort kinemax so appoint in space appointing spacepy how can we define appointee and what are the things that's really that's fine or define it with respect to some spell what is really important is to think about a point is the fact that the definition of appoint everyone of you probably think that's right we can use a vector to define the but what really is going to determine the vector is another point add reference point the the origin that you using to define the point if you change the original will change the fact so we will talk about the description of a point with respect to another point the sum origin and this point is going to be represented by a vector and this factor people describe this point with respect to this origin if we change origin we will change the voice ok if you have 2 points we define again the origin and then we will have two different factors representing this and these are those factors build by taking the connection between the origin to the phone medicine I'm interesting in this because now he going to introduce this origin and then we will be able to describe the factor components of the vector is independent of this x y and z with friend we are taking now we're going to According it and then we can express this factor in that if I change the orientation of the frame the vector is the same the coordinates the components of the vector will change are you going to be interested in Ghost transformations between different description that involve different phrase we will work with orthonormal frames xy&z we will go from one frame to another so in this case xy&z and we did a small rotation so about the same Origin and we ended up with a different friend and we need to know how we can take a description of the coordinates of p end the frame x y and z and then go to a description in frame Explorer my prime and zip and this is going to happen using transformation now this transformation is just rotating the the frame about the same point that we might have a prismatic joint and then we are going to translate that so there will be a translation so we need not only to deal with rotation in the friends but also translation well a free mobility related to something beyond the point the fact that just working with points Wii Resort dog needs really to worry about the orientation what is really happening is that you have different points honour rigidbody and when we rotate we are keeping the distance but orientation is changed so a frame is really related to the description of erosion when we take this rigid body take a fixed and attach to it a frame I'm calling this frame be so the coordinates Irish going to be described with respect to the axis x be so this is the frame be we do not YB and ZB and the frame itself is me and the question is how we describe the frame B with respect to a fixed frame so as you know we need to find the relationship between the origins so there is an origin of frame and origin of friend we need this factor between the two and that is defined by a vector and this factor is going to locate the origin of friend be with respect to frame and we have a description in the frame so this is pie orientation of the frame is these factors x by b&z be these vectors can have descriptions in different frames now we are describing them in frame so XD in a and this is the notation we do not XD and here we put a to say this all the coordinates of XP in frame so vectors are going to describe the relations of be with respect to frame it's actually if you think about those vectors and the relationship with the frame we really going to find the rotation wish the 1st model that we need really to use in order to describe the rotations of when.is.it body with respect to another so because we are concerned with just the rotations I'm going to slide this frame and make pie equal to Z so we will just move to the origin and just think about the rotation and in this case we will Focus only on the rotation Matrix and the rotation of that frame with respect to frame 8 so we're now concerned with the rotation frame B with respect to frame this rotation is described by a mate it's called the rotation mate and it has 9 we are calling them all 11 231 free ok I know some of you know the Willows the rotation matrix how many of funerals perfectly the notation Matrix I remember how many of Europe this is very important so better fencing lots of you sing this for the first time but I'm sure everyone has seen it come in some form or Another what I'm going to do I'm going to say state a description of what is the relationship between xbds vectorxd and XA xb define inframe bee obtain by this rotation Matrix and the vector the resultant vector is XV in frame so the description of EXP in be is now transformed into a description affects me in a using the rotation matter what is the EXP in b 100 are the X Factor in its own frame has unit when you know along the direction so it's 100 so what about why it is the same thing 010 right about z00 yay this is Vector XYZ in their own frame and now using the rotation matrix we have the description we have their component in the A-frame so the rotation matrix is basically this I'm just using the definition so if you multiply the first call is XV in a the second column what is the rotation Matrix the rotation Matrix between B and a is simply the component of XP in a component of y in a component of DNA ok always remember this definition this is very very important because we are going to find the rotation mate through many different ways sometimes you're looking at a problem and you are looking at the French look at the component of that frame in the other frame and you you will make sense of your result and this is always the the rotation matrix essentially the columns of the rotation matrix or the component the axis XYZ of the new frame in the reference ok alright so this is the definition of the rotation matrix from B28 is XP in a YB in A and C B so how do you open XD in a how do you obtain the component of they inflamate you just do the dog fart so essentially if you do that father of x B with x y and z you will attend it's been nice so which means the rotational mattress is essentially the doctor xb with x y and z y b with x y and z z with x y and z ok good so focus on this and look look look look look look at this role do you see anything any anything like special so here you have x x x x y z here you have anything consumed xaxaxa so it's the dot product of x a word x by b&z b which is you see this wishes XA in b written as always shipments transports this is very interesting because if we start looking at this property see that this rotation mattress is either the component of b in a or the transpose of the Rose of a in b so be in a in b inverse relation going from B to a going from A to B so going from A to B we are able to see that it is just the transpose which means that B28 the rotation family to a is equal to the transpose of a to b entropy is the inverse b2a so we have this property if I'm trying to compute to the inverse of the rotation matrix B to a which visits A2B it is simply B28 transport so the transfers of this metric is simply I mean the inverse of this matter is simply it's transpose and that's a very important property and this property comes naturally because the rotation Matrix found with this unit vector that's all Tarzan so the metric is called also mum and this automatic is always going to have this property it's inverse is right example can you compute the retest I think you have it is don't look at your notes now for the six so could you give me the first column of the rotation matrix from B to a what is the first column going to so it is the component of xb on a and XP on auc XV and xkr Alliance oh so anyone who could say what are the company the 100 what about y why has a component only along the right why is only a live is here zero bulbs what about Zee V has a component along the - y axis and it's for component - 10 really simple example research what we have done essentially what we are doing we are going either dot product between the two vectors or looking at the component of that Factor in at the same time if you think about this is EXP in a y b n a and c b in a this is our definition and in the other direction if you're it is x transpose in b so if you're digging and Express it in be it's going to be 100 transport so this rose represent x a n b x y a n b and va so now we know the addition Matrix Mitsubishi finally representation for original so we know how to represent the frame the rotation of the frame we need the translation of the origin an by combining the description of the rotation that is those vectors and by locating the origin of the frame be with respect to a we are going to define fully the frame B with respect to frame a so the friendly is essentially defined by this rotation Matrix b2a by the location of the origin with respect to a ok tell various different ways of thinking about the use of notation math end effector we can think about it we have done so far which is to say we have a better pee we have a frame friend and essentially we are expressing the component of friend in frame a in French and we are looking at the relationship between the two so this is what we call Maddie that is we are changing the description of a vector from one frame to another the Victor remain the same there is another way of thinking about it wishes so this is the way we are looking at it you have a vector and this factor p is going to be described bye it's dark product with to give you it's component in a and this is the same thing I've just removing the weather outside and putting it has a metric so a transpose y and z transport you see this writing isn't the same I'm here I'm I'm doing that father and just if you move the outside it's means you are doing that multiplication with the different Rose so now if you have this relation you can say candy Express in any frame in this operation could be represented in NYC which is let select be the frame b or c or d that you have to be consistent you have to take the same description and if you do that essentially you're opening that nothing that is you are retaining be in by rotated to give you pee in a this is changing the description of the theme back from one frame to another Hindi translation we are going to start by considering the same problem while maintaining the same orientation of the I'm going to slide this frame and change the location of the origin of the frame so friendly and free may has the same orientation and we're going just to move along the direction of the vector p so if we have a vector if we have a point in space it is located with respect to Origin b and described by the vector p the same point in space is described with respect to another origin a with a different vector ba so it is the same point that describe will respect to different points with different origins attached to do different frames and you end up with two different voice so this was our initial description in frame die and now we have a new description this transformation is resulting in two different back you have to be alive country to the case when we were doing just rotations now when we do a translation we are going to change the description by changing the factors involved into this so so this operation that involve a translation of a vector p defining this origin of the frame be changing the description from origin B2 origin and the relationship between the two that is the relationship between the green Victoria and the red factor is essentially this relation that is giving us the vector with respect to a origin as the sum of the vector with respect to Origin and the translation Orange so this fact that we have no two different Factor is going to appear later in homogeneous transformation and make the transformation little bit different from rotation because we are introducing a translation and we are introducing this non-homogeneous relation in the Marvel so when we come to general transfer so now I'm saying I'm going to have a description of this the same point that with respect to an arbitrary frame be that is rotated with respect to a then we need to account for this rotation and that means that in the description here is not simply the song that I have to do the same with respect to descriptions in the SIM free that is I cannot add this voucher directly with this letter I need to rotate this vector to frame and that me we have this relation this generation that is we take the description of pay with rotated to frame a we have its description of a and we have the origin description of a and now we can add them together and the result is this we we haven't sent anything we still are talking about this vector + vector = this back we have to make sure that this description is rotated correctly to frame this is the general transform and infer using this applying between links we should be able to compute and propagate go from wrestling to the next to the next to the next this description is not though not simple to carry when you have multiple links because you don't it's not like a rotation matrix wear with a rotation matrix if you know the first rotation with the friend with respect between two frame and you know that the two are rotated with respect to a different frame all what you need to do is to multiply the rotation mattress in here you have to carry some and you have to carry those relations so a better way to handle this transformation is to try to put it in a homogeneous phone how can you do this is sum of two vectors in three dimensional space you cannot haven't inhomogeneous for but if you go to 4 dimensional space then you can put it in homogeneous form do you want to see how so I'm just writing the same thing and I'm going to just add one more role for nothing so this role is saying when is equal to 1 if you multiply this vector by this Matrix you obtained the first relation right and the second part is 1 equal to 0 x the vector p + 101 equal to but now we have captured the homogeneous property that is this vector is transform into this vector this description is transferring to this description using the rotation Matrix and translation you see that and this is what we call the homogeneous Transformers it's a 4 by 4 m you have four component that are doing nothing except help the man to make this transformation imagine in that when we go from A to B to c today it's just a x but we have to handle 404 mattresses instead of 3 by 3 mm so this is this is a very important component now by the way sometimes 0001 the definition of is on the top so sometimes you define 1p instead of it is exactly the same competition stop here is an example of the homogeneous transformational have two factors and taking the frame you remember the frame we the example we saw earlier the example where we had a rotation matrix with rotating rotating about the x-axis so I'm just translating now the origin of be with this factor 031 so the homogeneous transformation so it is the same rotation matrix as before and 031 the vector describing the origin of frame be in frame and you're amazing this formation is hit and now using the summer dinners formation you can compute the new position of the point b so the point in frame b is described by 011 this is the the point and looking and to find this vector you all that you need is to take this transformation and multiply this vector by distance but you have to add one so we take the 011 we add one and the multiplication leads to 0 to 2 and 1 you drop the one the answer is 0 to 2 so if you look over there this was happening in this plane so essentially here we have one and this is too and one and two just do it ok Cliff ok now that you understood everything I'm going to confuse I mean nothing now we have 222 computer changed the intuition now instead of mapping with going to to so rotation matrix I said allows you to describe the same butter into different frames but now I'm going to take the rotation matter and use it to rotate a vector so the actor was here I'm going to rotated my the rotation mate I said the mapping is changing the Script an operator is moving those points in space well that could be used for you have actor you have one friend you have a description another firm have a disco now but I'm going to do I'm going to do a rotation and this rotation will rotate the fact invite a rotation Matrix wish I could describe the relationship between the component of us the same Factor into different frame in this way can be also used as an operator that was operate on a Vectra P12 produce a vector Pichu and this is very useful later when we computer presentations you 5 very useful to compare transformation between so are here operating and P12 produce Pete ok so Peter is the rotation apply to the vector P1 and of special interest are those rotation that take place about some specific acts like The xx The Wire dizziak summer edition so then you can talk about or eggs with some angle for and will will be at very useful some of the operations in general we can talk about a rotation about a k vector not the XYZ but any arbitrary and it's rotate a vector 31 in 2 vector P2 so here is an example this is a rotation about the x so the exactive is 100 and the rotation about the x-axis is of data it is cosine theta minus sine you know this familiar mattress rotation about the x-axis so if you take the 1 wishes has component on Y and Z so it's 0 to 1 0 to 1 if you take this mattress your end up with 012 which is over there 1 to ucp1 and Peter so this is the Victor 021 2 and 1 and now 012 01 and 2 translation the same thing we can now instead of describing a point with respect to do the French we are going to translate that using an opera so in the mapping we talk the vector with respect to be and produce a vector with respect to a in the operator so and operator this is what is happening we are changing the point we going from P2 to P1 so this point be one moved so we have two different point and two different so when you are translating you are thinking about it like in the rotation the rotation we had the vector the one we rotated to Peter now we have hear a vector 31 with this translation is essentially is producing is producing this point so I have to remove this you can see it better so we are moving D12 Peter with the translation B&Q sopito is P 1 + q this is an operator of translation and you can have this operator q along the x-axis y-axis and z-axis or any arbitrary so a translation through the operator q with result into a different vector and now you have describe it you can describe it in frame or any other frame but through always maintaining the same relation and his same description for all the factors when you apply the when you apply the components for describing the premier have to make sure that you is describing the same frame D1 and the result will be in the same car so now we can think about this operator as the this operator 111 that is there is no rotation at all but there is only translation QX qyq and this is defined by the Q so the translation is done by QX QI and Q's and now you can combine the two you can combine the rotation and translation so you could have an operator operating my translating and rotating so the general operator that you can imagine is this operator rotating about some factor ok with some angle theta and translating q so the point p which was in P1 now is rotated and Translate and the result is and this is without any definition of the frame then you define The Fray English you want to express all these vector but you have to make sure you are using the same frame for all the operation so this is the most general form transformation between two different point it is the same homogeneous transformation it is the interpretation that transformation whether it changing the description or operating and changing the pots ok are you enough confused good so do you think we we we will sort the transformation it is the same homogeneous transformation that is has taken probation Translate rotation maths origin of those French and that can give us mapping changing the description and I just discussed the other interpretation that you could have wishes to change the Victor it says and that means change the points describing boss rotate so when your rotator factory you are going from one point to another point or when you're translating your are going from one point to another and you can apply motive and now we're going to look at the inverse now in the case of rotations the invoice is very simple what is the inverse of the rotation matrix from B to a transport now for a homogeneous transformation this is not the case we can say it is transpose that is this Matrix is not auto normal because the presence of this translation so the inverse is not exactly that does transfer transfers of this matter if you're almost because if you look at the inverse of this matter it involves the transfers of if your ticket my block you you will see that you have inverse hair this is the same the only thing you have here is the description the inverse of this vector what is this I mean if we were thinking about this invoice it is going from A to B so this is the origin of a in French so basically you are just writing here the origin frame ok so now we know the four we know the inverse of homogeneous transformation and it is going to be a sense homogeneous transformation we going to use it describe the kinematic chain of the manipulator and you will see that this transformation it could be described by boss 4 parameter the DH parameters so we will be able to describe each relation between successive lines just using for parameter the Deep parameter so I will not reveal the movie segment for next time but unless you have any question Wigan any question will stop here and will see you on Wednesday
