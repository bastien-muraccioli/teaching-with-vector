this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development ok let's get started so today we're going to the zoo and this video segment which comes from 93 this is from Bangor University quite interesting style of gib shown in this video it's called brachiation abbreviation Road the dynamically mobile robot models on the Gibbon move from branch to branch swinging it's body like them the brachiation robot which we have the belt has two arms and no body the total length is 1 mm and a total weight is 4.8 kg the arms and grippers for actuated with DC Motors to harmonic drive this is the movement without actuation at first the robot doesn't know how to move it all now the robot is going to learn her to locomote to the next bar motion planning of such a robot is a difficult problem because of its non-halal anime I Robot is able to generate desirable motions by itself using a new heuristic method the algorithm is based on trial and error of animals including b top 10 bedroom Ocean after the motion learning process the Roebuck and locomote from branch to branch forward and back pastor of the robot is measured by gyroscope built into the arm and the joint angles are measured by encoder the robot is calibrating a script and closes it when it approaches the target for this motion is so cold the underhand mode the robot can perform another motion called the overhand mode this motion is naturally more difficult than the underhand because the robot has to stop the turning of the arm against the gravity force and the movement is liable to become unstable however I Robot also succeeded in performing continuous overhand locomotion it needs more torque than the underhand this is more efficient respect to time an energy when the robot fails to catch the target bar it can recover by swinging with arms to obtain energy by Method based on parametric excitation by continuously performing to motion namely the motion to control the swing amplitude in the motion to approach the target the robot can catch the target bar from any initial state indeed well this project continued and the probably will see some more alright let's get back to the so today I'm going to cover if you examples I know this is so maybe boring puppy that we really need to understand how we can do famous because this is only way you can generate the full of kinematic and what we're going to see is that once we have the DH parameters essentially we will have the forward kinematics which means we know the position and orientation and little later impact on Wednesday we will see how this can help us finding the jacobian and later on we will see how can we find the dynamic so these are very important parameters defined this parameter you define your robot Kinema you need to add the Masters and a few additional things and then we we have all the mods ok so you remember this time I discussed her the attachment of frames and we emphasise the fact that we have those axes the joints that are going to play an important role because what access will provide us with first of all the information about the distance between access which is the common normal so we identify these you have one here one here one here and when they are intersecting basically that distance is zero and that point is very important then we continue with the finding all the origins which are defined they remember how the Redefined the origins anyone hey how do we define the horror for the first so we we take the intersection of the common normal with the previous axis and that give us origin origin it says we said the joint axes would be align with the Z axis so we are selecting h y axis along access so we have Z1 Z2 Z3 Z4 Z5 ok and we said once we have no see access we have the origin now we take to be along the common normal or perpendicular to the plane containing the successive zodiacs ok end that is so in this case we're going to have the Saxons and we also define the different parameters for amateurs to distances and Twingo a it's called what the length of the links ring slide and what is the distance between the CI access soai is the distance between z i and z i + 1 measured along dick sayak ok how far is the angle between these two z-axis the same access VI and add plus one measure about x in the right direction and the 12-hour parameters are one of them is valuable either the day which measure distance between x axis so it's measuring the distance from the previous acts to the current along is the I access and this could be a prismatic displacement or a constant of the last one is this the most common thing that we're going to see it to the joint angle because those most of those joints are joined and we going to measure the single about the Zi axis between excite - 1 the previous ex and the next so I'm going to take an example we're going to work out this example and this is a typical example of the things that you have in your homework in Mitcham in the finals this or simple examples that we will try to design so simple enough so you can Southam and also interesting enough with the difficulties of assignment and and everything indeed so you see this red frame we are introducing we are giving you a frame we are calling it X5 Z5 this is a frame at dash to the end effector this is our task and the the goal is to find the transformation from the base to that frame so we need to find the DH parameters up to this phone this frame is given to you can be not given we can ask you to assign it we are giving you the lost thing so also I should notice this is the typical way we describe the kinematics of schematic kinematics of a robot and I'm not sure if all of you are familiar with what you see here is that you have an access this is a joy to access this representation describes a joint the output of wish define the next acts so this is coming at the output of joint one and the sliding joint here that slice like this is a prismatic joint so we're presented this way and output is coming to the fine the link that leads to the next joint so if I can get my cursor back so this is the iPad and here you have the next level a joint when was the presenter of this way we mean that the axis is perpendicular to the plane when you represented here we say the axis is in the plane ok and I put is defining what is this joint and the output of the joint is connected to the ent yeah play play prismatic joint actually is sliding a longer sex you see these two point miss all the sliders so it's smooth so it's most to the left and to the right so we have only here one joint that has an Access coming out of the plane and this one is the religion you're asking me if we have the keys Basmati joint that is coming out of the plane well that might happen and you will see the difficulty there is a way of representing but when we do it we usually use a sort of 3D representation to show you how it's coming so I think an important thing to remember is this is not mekanism describing one configuration you should try to imagine how this mechanism is moving so you have to somehow Capture the Flag if we rotate about the first axis the end of factory will move out of the plane UC rotates about the first act if it's like so just move is Axis and see the end effector can you see that it's like now if you're a bit about the certain joint what is going to happen we will in the plane if we were in that configuration and when you move about the last joint we got out of the plane about that access you see that so you need really to imagine that motion because go to analyse the Workspace of the robot you need to fill that work space and you need to find a way to imagine the three-dimensional motion of the mechanism and a find the volume that is found by the motion of the intellect no what we need to do is to do the famous I know and we are going to start by assigning origins and and z-axis in this case we have a lot of things that are already there so you see the first join the axis the second one what's particularity about those access we have so joined one and join two r intersected so the intersection point is going to be an important point in this case join 3 and joined to are they intersecting so they are so tough for what the two parallel planes and the next one the last joint is interrupting with the retired number 3 this mechanism prismatic and that's rtrr ok any questions before we start so let's start and I'm going to start by putting the Z axis and the origin so the Z1 is along access joint one zito along zito Z3 is coming out of the plane Z4 is along that rotation and there is basically no question all of these are directly assign very simple and we are introducing already a distance and this is coming from in fact it will be clearly defined when we we put the origin so origin one is there but could you explain why we are selecting origin one at the Dartford add intersection of access 1 and access to yes minimum number of variables that you Ponderosa I didn't think about origin zero before Addison Sara you're right before original one This is England because you have the intersection alpha Zeta and 01 at that point this point we cancel order frame 10001 is in post we put 40 the origin of Enzo and that location because we want to minimise the number of promise if we put all 0 lower or higher we will have a Distance that we need to account for it in the parameters here so for origin free I'm in Brixton O2 O2 comes to be here if we and how did we assign it at this location it is the common normal intersecting with access D2 we got O2 what about O3 where is going to be turn off free will be somewhere here alright ok so far so good now all4 so how many different authorities became normal between what did you say between so lady 53 we said it is the intersection of 3 with 4 right 44 it is 4 and 5 so because we define 5 we have the common normal between the two how many common normals you have infinite so we have a choice we can put all four in different location we're going to select or 4th and that will contribute to as we will see to minimising the number for armour ok now let's introduce those parameters so you are doing this problem but there are not enough I mean so what what is a 0 is there a is the distance between which axis 01 and they are going to them so 0 ok no what about a 1 so it is again distance between the Z axis 1 and 2 0 what about I'm free that will give us a 2 so this song list so the artist and that are not written on the figure and we are going to introduce them so you introduce anytime those distances so now we are going to need parameters that describe the distance from O2 to O3 and that distance we we just put annel you call it whatever L2 we are going to need that distance which is actually depending on the location of 405 and we are going to need this distance to 05 duac 5-minutes dance between The xx I'm sorry well this you will see this world come to be associated with the with the following phrase that's why you are putting that in this you're not going to use the you're not going to have but need for an L3 ok so when we start building the the table so we're going to you need to assign the X Factor I mean so far I'm introducing those parameters without ready assigning the access and deciding what are the signs of those parameters that's what we need to do is to put the x so what is the first 1 x 1 what is x 1 going to be so it will be x 1 is perpendicular to so it's probably to the plane containing Z1 and Z2 so it could be in or out of this plane we are selecting X1 out if we select X1 in that is fine but that will change the sign of the the angle between the X1 and the following acts so x2 explore is how how do we define x2 it is a longer Common normal and it's boring from 02203 and that is XD ucx to ok a lot of fun now extra where is Exeter V3 Z4 intersecting it could be the same direction Isaac's lior in opposite direction we are putting Extra in Dudley up you agree if you're putting down the angle change when you measure it and that account and since then it's relation to explore we get accounted for everything is fine annex 4 because we selected all four there X4 will go from 042 the access zee5 so it would be that ok so it is along the common normal from 425 alright so now I'm going to show you the table and you are going to see all the parameters and I think you have them in your hand so I wanted to see if you can compute them without checking your table can you do that without looking so don't look and let's try to find the defined a few of these parameters so if we were to find the parameter Alpha 2 so this is Alpha 2 so what is Alpha 2 Alpha 2 is an angle between access 2 and 3 right measured about x2 so you you go from 23 UC access to UC access 3 and you're measuring about extinct so how many what is the Vango 90 Plus or minus - because you're going this so I'm going to show you the table and then let's check more little more just to mix with you so was it when Alpha 2 is minus 90s song latest score in the configuration shown in this configuration can you give me what is the value of data 1 what is data 0 escort wife data one is measuring measuring an angle between the XR between exit from ek02 X 1 about the Z axis and the two are confident in this configuration what is the variable enjoin to what is the valuable enjoyment beta so if I I think about a variable qq1 Q2 to q1 is fatal Q2 is d to the valuable so what is the value of Q2 in the configuration shown it's about this so how many inches lettuce the configuration show ok so you just to measure it and that would be the configuration what is that what about 83 what is the value cedar tree in the configuration shown payday 3 is measuring X2 to x 3 about 0 exteriors uca store the extra day ucxt it's up and x-ray is up ok correct so let's do something more yeah before D4 is the distance between 3 x 4 when is X3 and explore 0 80 how come this is not good let's fix thank you yes there was a question set that a convention pick your MS Access set a timer alpha was always mystery oh well I don't think you you need to I mean you cannot maintain that so I mean there are also so many different faints you cannot keep your you pick it for the first one and then it becomes negative into next one so I don't think this is you cannot you can never maintain the sign of that from XI - 12 I will navigate from yeah so I mean as not as you you can't you have a choice and you can select it positive then you do it and that is fine but if you put it negative it is fine as well it's overall if you start with the minus the way you are Sonia x in or out will change the song any selection you you make in or out will result in the same answer because the angles will account for that there was a question alright ok I'm going to pick a more more realistic example and this is so real robot we will see this robot here later this is the the Stamford the shaman on which Simon designed and built this robot this is a six degrees of freedom it's Among The Few abouts in the world has a prismatic joint so the third join on this robot is a translating so when you born here you are moving along this act the axis of translation so this is a prismatic joint and it has this rest that has 3 degrees of freedom 3 intersecting x actually as you walk in and out you can see Yale alarm in the museum exposition on the first floor and you can see this on over there so what are you doing to do with going to find the forward kinematics for this and this is going to require us to go through the DH parameters first but then we are going to compute this transformation associate with the days parameter defined all the transformation for this robot then we multiply them out and find X Y and Z at the end effector and find this orientation of the end of factory giving the joint and the prismatic joint location right we ready yes horror the first how can we do this well we need a canal we need the to see this joints axis and we need here is a schematic we're going to use this sort of 3D so in this case the first join always we are using the the same Concepts you have a rotation the output is going to the next joint rotation so let's let Me Explain so the first rotation the first rotation of the arm this rotation about its axis here and then wish is connected to the second one so I'm showing you this way this here is in the plane containing this access Andersons of bagenalstown so when you rotate about this axis this whole structure rotate ok and when you repeat about this axis the following structure without it about this now this whole structure translate in and out along this joint the output of this joint is attached to with three joints of joints that are intersecting at this point and that phone structure so this is in the wrist you have the joint joint joint 5 don't for Gentry is prismatic joint 1 and 2 hour of dragon and joined one rotate the whole structure going to rotate the structure following about this so you have these two first intersect do you see this mechanism now little bit now the Lost is rejoignez are going to affect orientation so if we think about this is when we Motors this structure and the intersecting point is here so this this point of is the intersection destruction rotate about this axis it rotates about this axis this is James five so joined Cory's like this join 5 is a long list accessed and John 6 is a long hair so if you put your hand here and rotate this your rotate about the Z axis if you pull it out it wouldn't it about this access and if your extended completely and rotate your joints 6 this joint 6 and joint for will become a line that is this join and this joint become aligned if you're reading this app and make this joint and disjoint power and this is a special configuration about configuration we call it kinematic singularity because when we move this joined up and the two are aligned we cannot rotate anymore about this xx we are walk scope lock so when joint 5 is equal to 0 so we going to do the forward 
 play the first access to agri the one zito going to be long s John Z3 I wonder why I put it there Z4 zee5 and this ok any question about the Z axis that we have h e x disorder x joint along the axis of the joint replace this act and obviously we pl02 belong with the one in that configuration places the origin Z1 0 at the same original zito why the origin is there where's Z3 ok 4 5 already this point is going to be the origin of 345 and Oliver Kama normals perpendicular to 1/2 X1 UC 120-122 X1 do Anthony exto no free 5 and so x 2 is the common normal on in the plane 2 and 3 now 3 and 4 yes what temperature we can put it up work play doesn't matter doesn't matter tell if you if you put it up or down download old one that changes is the alpha angle and the data angle and the following angles and everything will be accounted for so there is no proper so extra will be along the six explore and X5 is perpendicular to 5 and 6 so it will be selected this way you can select the other 6 is selected a long the same direction of 5 so we are saying this position l 6 equal to 0 ok how do you say exam is going to be selected here if we selected in the opposite direction it will introduces a beta that is different from zero here the theater 1 is equal to 0 so introduce distances now we need a distance between the X1 and X2 axes this is due to we need a distance between the origin Z2 and Z3 and what else we need I think that is we just need this to promise ok and here we have our definition assign and find the value this time I'm going to introduce this one by one yes turn on stereo have any information stop the wrist joint and IB end of the oh that's so we are you didn't introduce the love Frankie so there is no friends the seven we did not introduce attend this friend z7 could be introduced later in anyway without any problem the point 0403 amine that intersection point is part of the the loft so it's just the first point on battling and anything you you select later would be fine because you are not introducing any valuable it's account Transformers this is what I said lost because benefactor is here we can think about this point but we might think about the end of the tool held by the end of practice oh that frame is always changing so most of the time what we do is we compute the transformation to the response and then we got her an additional transformation for the task so we're going to do the first one and we need alphazero A0 d1nz Tower so so we can't stop like and just refill quickly so what is alphazero why how far away is the angle between z-axis which ones 021 antioxidant and what about a 0 because the intersecting and what about D1 you want is what distance between xx Sarah anything left later one the latest 801 ok Google and if is equal to in this configuration is there bigger x 0 and x 1 are pause irritate we are going to repeat X1 away from x 0 and that will give us the volume ok number two let's start from the other side what is Peter it's viable stated to what about D2 video messages the distance between between what between what access X1 and x2 X1 and x2 ucb2 sorry to be too and what about I shouldn't tell to an ex yeah I always didn't I mean I never liked the use of ditto later on I calitro two so we are really not confused with with the the constant but anyway we call it due to not going to confuse you with could be a verb Hewitt Cycles what about the a 2 I mean a 1 why play distance between A1 will measure 1 to 2 1 and 2 are 
 so the viable was alpha why it's - 90 what is this alpha-1 alpha one is measuring the angle between 1 N20 1NZ to you go from Z1 does Ito about X1 so this way -9 so if you X1 on question was that if we put the X just get a different angle but now I'm the following one your account first so you you get positive for the first that you pay for it later ok ok 3 is what is data 243 what is data free for the third joint play battery x22 free 4 x 3 is down explore is down measure about the free Z3 is this way anyone care for me what is Status 34 Joinery 0 everyone sees it Zara what team is facing down the same way home ok zx2 ok external ears placing down because it is perpendicular to the plane containing Z2 and Z3 right so it could be up or down well if you put it up a stall if you put it out because formation between X1 and X2 will change ending from 23 will change but right now this election and you have a selection you are accounting for Sono X2 and X3 or cover the angle between them is 0 so that will be what about the D3 D3 is the distance between the x axis right xx 32x and what is the distance between x-ray to explore along busy 3 this is the displacement this is you see as you move Translate this is not a joint you are going to slide D3 D3100 increase it's the valuable so it is by 3 divided Ender 20D 3808 between the Z access this is 0 and alpha is 90 degree so alpha3 is margarine Z3 and Z4 and this is night addict about X4 ok now what's your reach this location free actually you have the transformation to frame three wishes art the intersection point of the road and basically you have your position of the interfactor I mean the the position as the intersection address this position is not going to change anymore because all the other friends are going to have the same Origin so this distance between the origin here and here is going to remain the same plate what's going to change with the next Jones is the orientation of this frame how this joint move will affect the orientation of the so Z4 will have only one variable data for n zee5 will have al an alpha for that is equal to -90 degrees the Alpha is the angle between 5 z6 and the last one 90 degrees with l ok yeah 4 a.m. you have a shouldn't it be like Elvis I didn't hear why is it 4 tell you have to under the eye video is not variable about it earlier if you want I can change it on online s l l 2 please I'm sorry it's so every year I have to change it and forgot to do it can I do it I can do it let's play bedspread no we have the table goof well you going to do fuel and there will be always one more column configuration show and you have to remember that you're looking at this configuration and just got to move it little bit and look what is the value of the vile ok so now that we have the next one please so Isha please Asia this song I'll do it now because I'm sure he was forgot and save it I'm sorry oh yeah thank you ok so now every row that you have here for 12345 is going to give you a transformation you're going to use this information and you're going to have a transformation so if we go here we going to find the transformation from this is not ones that my god what is happening to someone didn't find all the mistakes alright so this is going from i-to-i - 1 this is the transformation that you are going to compute as a function of your alfa-a dian keto so you have these four parameters and you're going to use them to compute this transformation ok and as long as you you are doing the assignment following this convention you can apply this phone so we're going to start is the table and we do the first transformation you have 5-minutes Ankara so let's do the first transformation the first transformation is very simple the only thing on the first row that is variable in Stata one and you can find 3 x 1 1 - 77 st801 and Society and then you have a one here so this is what your paint the transformation from frame 1250 is simply a rotation about the zodiac ok and the origin is 0 the same as now the next transformation is going to be from Frame 2 to 10 20 you have to be careful so it will involve only one variable unless transformation involves cosine to and signed to and because the origin is different UCD to appear which is now should be able to oh my god this is good this is going to be released we keep going I cannot the winter start what about 3 to 1 3 to 2 is the transformation 322 involve only this variable D3 there are no variables in the rotation there are 90 degrees which gives you a sign and sign of 0 and then basically you get cancer and Danny transformation involved there is this read-only volume ok so we continue 43 524 and 625 have you written everything down Robert now how can you compute the the hurricane Nevada are we going to multiply that is we going to say the total transformation from frame and 250 is we start from n n - 12 101 x mouth so here is 120 here is 220 how did your team 220 now to do this multiplication you can start from here you can multiply in and -1 by this and you get 1 matrix multiply this and there are many ways to do this during this month I'm going to just inside the fact we are going to do it in a specific way because later the way we will do it we will find intermediate competition that will help us find the jacobian so the jacobian actually we will see that the jacobian reliance on this fact that is the Z factor of the rotation in frame 0 so we need the Z Factor in French 0 in order to find the factor in French we will start doing this multiplication by taking 12021 by 120 that give us and now I have the vector Z 2 in flames this is E2 in French 0 and this is Z3 in friends are you the Spectre so this record is going to play a very important role later so we do the multiplication always this way we take 120 220 320 just multiplying one matrix by the previous one so we start from the and do the multiplication concussion well when I reach 30 look what we have here this represent the rotation of frame 3 with respect to frame 0 this is 3-in frame 0yy in French 0 Z3 influenza and this is what the origin of frame 3 in French 0 no notice this is going to remain the same as we continue because we selected the same Origin so the origin will not change what is it you see that call is the Singh so this was calling here to sign when d3s still - 1 D2 well if you go here it is the same it is the same it is the same that what is growing is what is this what is this what's this represent transformation 6-in 0 what is this this isn't effective lost frame flame 6 I have why and z z6 in Friends is so complicated you have the sine cosine of 1 cosine of two cosine of sine of 5 always are the component to complete the component of that law vector z6 in French 0 this it's Xbox One component and AC component you see it now this these three columns or rotation match from France to frame 0 now in this transformation I have ever about the Sloth frame we have x axis component in 50 the y-axis component in French and the z-axis component are not showing you be still because there is no room and the origin of frame six with respect to the origin frames so you have everything so now you can from a set of parameters describe your position and orientation you can say I would say yyz to represent my end effector position and then what are you going to select pick something so what options we have the remember we we had this in the first letter I think what's second Life we have angles like the angles Catania other angles or Direction cosines what are the direction cosines just picked this you have 123456789 numbers that will give you your direction to science representing essentially all the parameters in the addition match involved with the Orient stop so this is what we're going to do going to put the position exp the coordinates of the position I will use Cartesian coordinates xyz and that will be this tree and now I'm going to use the three columns or one or two or 3 to the present address this is big this is big and this is big so what I'm sending you is the smallest part so this is what this is the z6 axis in frame 0 this is the y6 axis in Friends arrow and this is X6 access in French so the forward kinematic if we don't care about the orientation is very recent if we care about the orientation and we do care about and kiss it is not very easy to capture and now go ahead and find me the three angles associated with this how do we do that well we go and sorry this metrics rotation matrix is identify two three rotations and we compute the inverse of the cosine how far you remember beta and then we make sure it's not 0 no thank you very tea and then we extract alpha and and gun and and all of that requires you to take those values numerical values you private because what does it mean C1 cosine theta 1 so you black United 81 from your encoder you get the value of that and you you have no percent 801 and sign faded so the orientation part is quite interesting and that is going to be all the way interesting as we go to the jacobian in fact this part the Z Factor is very very because we will see later the jacobian is going to be born by just deserve actor Z1 in French 002 inflamed 004 to the end that gives you half of jacobian and the other have a bazooka Wilma distance has to be just simple differentiation of this free y&c coding so once we understood the forward kinematics in terms of the position and orientation and then once we understood how when we move the different joy when we produce velocities advertised we have fact then effective velocity with linear and angular velocity then we are going to be able to create this transformation between joint velocities 20 factor velocities that uses the knowledge of the axis of rotation of different chart this vector is important because about this factor that we have the velocity of the joint the z-axis you remember we selected rotation about the zodiacs so the state that one is measure about the zodiac and that is going to play a very important role any questions alright well I'll see you on Wednesday and we will start working with the jacobian
