this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development ok let's get started so today movie pregnant is about especially actuator probably you saw this on the first election but we will see some more details so this is so flexible actually showed that comes from Toshiba this was developed in the early 90s presented 90-91 video to ceilings this new actuator is made of fibre reinforced pneumatically or hydraulically is 3 degrees of freedom pitch you're and stretch which are adequate for robot mechanism such as fingers Arms or legs the actuator has three internal Chambers and the pressure in each can be controlled independently through flexible tubes the weather is certainly reinforced with fibre to resist deformation in the radial Direction the actuator can be flexing every Direction by controlling the pressure in the chamber develop actuators ranging in size from 1 mm to 20 mm in diameter this is the formula m actuator the design is easily measured because of its simple structure this is a modified version the rubber is reinforced spirali with fibre so that rotational movement is possible we can apply these flexible micro actuators to miniature robot manipulators MC really we getting on with many degrees of freedom and snake like movements this is a prototype consisting of 2 and a Mini Cooper seven degrees of freedom including the gripper is can a country's delicate which could be handle only with great difficulty by conventional robots constructing miniature robot manipulators easy also acts as the robot structure on the other hand combining the actuators in parallel results in a multi fingered robot hand play former dexterous hand with a delicate touch this prototype consists of four actuators each 12 mm in diameter and it has 12 degrees of freedom is able to handle fragile and complicated work with because the actuators deform to suit the shape of the workpiece itself adult is easily tightened with only rust settings of the position and orientation of the the actuators have such good compliance miniature robots with a soft toy and no conventional links can be created using these actuators we will see the use of flexible micro actuator stop what do you think what would be the advantages of using the match in this a lot more safer you said safety is a very very important aspect of the design of a robot especially if the robot is going to interact with a humans and you really don't want to this rovertou just go crazy and hit and make a lot ent so soft actuation using pneumatic is is very good because it's basically compliance right now another implication of the fact that you are using somatic is the structure of the robot is going to be lighter because if you think about operating this fingers with Motors or if you like think about an arm with Motors you need to carry the Motors you need to put gears you need a lot of structure to hand so definitely this is lighter safer more flexible comply all of any disadvantage yeah basically well I mean depends what you want to achieve but you can not expect achieve all the task what kind of task you cannot control size motion or fast dynamic if you want to change directions and because what is the problem with the with actual so yeah I mean basically the response of this is slow because you are using air pressure and you cannot push the air pressure to a point where you can really get Thursday night well later on in the Quarter we will see our accounts that combines to this idea of using chromatic which is light and result into a night light structure combine it with other type of actuation to bring hybrid actuation inner wave combines both the advantages of the light structure and the first Dynamics that we need to achieve all the different tasks that require the robot to respond quickly the lexicon you would see the robot was like turning ok anyone would like to answer this question and I'm sure you have an idea but this is very not fundamental to the robot design it is more on the fact that we have no external feedback or no no touch or we are not using the information about the dash to realise that we already left this is actually something that you can add on top of the design to like with what kind of sensory would use touch sensor yeah like you you want to know if you're touching or not colour in is going to change the band exactly we can put a sensor at the end that is localised at the tip of the Finger and then we can feel whether the sensor is it's on or off that is just touch but if you want to more information about the pressure you need a sensor an active sensor that would measure then the problem I mean oh no it we come into a much harder problem which is the fact that if you're holding something that's a little mention with your two fingers you're holding something and there is always sleep so you need to measure sleep so that you can play lots of pressure and to do that you'll need the sort of dynamic tactile sensor so there has been a lot of work actually in the group of market a lot of research on tactile sensing dynamical sensor end also the idea of using pressure is a very good idea because in fact by measuring the pressure and the control pressure if there is a difference between what you are expecting and what you see you will be able to due some information about there was so common 32 Panda know if your instrument being warmer obviously you will be able to get it out of information about the environment but that is cast so you want more to put the sensors on the robot another type of sensor that will give you more information about the environment bet especially what about whether you are incontinent Close or not look alive see where things are to see where things are to see Vision put the couple of cameras and you would see where where you are with her end so you have a mechanism you have the controllers but really you need to close the loop but the clothes the look you need forceps and perception could use sensors in the environment sensor external that are monitoring the environment or instrumentation on the robot this design actually was Pursuit for couple of years they built the even a big robot that is working with those legs I'm not sure if you will see it better projector I mean didn't go any further it is like many of the designs that make use of phone pressure only you end up with limitations a lot of limitations on the use of on that ability of the robot to perform task and if there is a lot of work today in this area that is with artificial muscles to create faster muscles that use air pressure in the there are many different solution that will push this little further but still you have limitations and I'll as I said we will discuss a little bit more about the issues of design especially in the context of safety because safety really really is is becoming a very important aspect in robot design because we have been working mostly with Rob with industrial Anisa robots are working alone or working with parts and abs you don't really worry too much if there is an accident just between the robot and that invite but if you are going to work with the humans you really have to make sure that there is no danger to the human and that is really challenging so we will come back any other comment about this so lit go back to Alexa so last time we we saw the storm we call homogeneous transform and the homogeneous transform really has several interpretations or can fulfill several functions they are in the first one of them is the fact that transformation like this allow us to describe the frame so friend is described with respect to frame a given this transfer so if I know the religion is transformation between B and a that is this 4 by 4 team Matrix that describes a b with a relation to a then I have a description of this frame be and this description contains the rotation of the axis of frame B with respect to a and the location of the origin of frame B with respect to Premier now we saw also that there is another roll this homogeneous transformation can play in the second roll turn the role whatever do you have an idea what can we use this transformation what can we what can this transformation help do yes operations that is we can interpret the transformation as an operator that is acting a vector and changing this factor rotating the Factor or rotating and translating that bad so this is a second interpretation the transformation as an operator or one more actor in space describe with two suns frame b and you want it description in a different frame 8 can you use this transformation this is the mapping what we call mapping that is we take a description of a vector p in a frame Welby and we offer to our description in frame vector be the screen vector or there is now the red factor that is this one describing this point in French and you can see here we have two different back there was no translation then basically it will be the same vector with two different set of components and I you said we have also the description homogeneous transformation as an operator that is we take a vector P1 and change it to a vector P2 so the vector B1 is now P2 after translation so this different roles the homogeneous transformation use the same mathematics but the application the interpretation is going to be and we have to pay attention to the way we apply the the Ned question that we have to address is how we now with you so if you remember when I packed about 20-minutes transformation I said buy building this match four by four metrics in higher dimensional space we are able to have a homogeneous relation between vector so this property is going to help us propagate and go from one frame to another and have descriptions related by the individuals transformations between friends so here is an example you have four this camera monitoring the environment and here in fact you have a robot a mobile manipulator this is Romeo that is that is so did I introduce from your injury at 2 ok well maybe we'll have a chat Al so Romeo is essentially a mobile platform how long I make mobile platform with with an arm and it allows you to move in the environment and manipulate the environment that because of the platform this is done everywhere in the world not like when you have just one on on a table where you bring material to be Pro here you are able to explore the human environment and in fact the robot is moving and it's location is always difficult so the question is how can we finsta locate this robe so you need to find a actually the transformation between the base frame of the robot with respect to the camera this is little bit difficult unless you are able to well to find elements and different does the first the camera is monitoring the end of fact so you have the internet factory here and you can see it so if you have this relation that is in a given frame you are able to see and identify vente Factor which is that say this frame then through the other parts that is going from here to the days through the transformations to the interfactor you have another bath you know this and you know this then you can compute this and we need to be able to propagate and resolve this Transformer question this comes everywhere yeah well Romeo is capable I running I will see you maybe later if we have a chance little van SO18 where your ironing where is the base and you have the slip in the environment if you are observing the invite and you need to be able to go through this from the base today interfactor you have always the forward kinematics through all the transformations between legs but obviously with the ground you have slippers and you can not determine exactly the relationship between a fixed camera and the location of the b So Festival how we we combined consider two frames consider that now we're going to introduce a third friend see so we have a transformation from c to b we have a transformation from B to a and obviously I'm interested in the transformation from sea to a the total transformation I would like to combine these two transformer so if we have a vector vector describe in C that is we have a point p describe the free MC the question is what is the description of this factor in frame the result is obvious I mean probably you already get it we are going to multiply this to transformation Enterprise let's first compute what is the transformation to frame me p in V is simply going to be updated by the homogeneous transformation from c to right now if we right the same thing for this point in B we can go to a through the homogeneous transformation B28 now if we substituted with the expression that uses see we will obtain this relation that is the Vector in C is transform into the description in frame using this phone which means that we are going from description in C to a that is from c to a and that means essentially the transformation corresponding to these two frame successive frames is going to be the product of the mattresses the homogeneous transformation CBB and beta and you can see this has a nice phone you just eliminate the b and you're going from c to a with this notice so what is villager advantage of I mean I'm a genius information is that you have a mattress and then when you have multiple frame so what you need to do is to multiply this mattress so now if we multiply c2b b2a this is what we will obtain we will see here that the structure this transformation is going to maintain the structure weather is back to the rotation so we have the same properties of probation it is c-2a through c b and b to a and this vector which is the origin the vector locating the origin of c with respect to a well it is essentially computed by locating the origin of c with respect to be rotating it to the right frame and then adding the office due to the origin of day with respect to 8 so the logic is very simple it's a vector competition but again when you do the multiplication it is automatically taking into account and you get those results so now that we have this relation that would allow us to combine two rotations we can go and do the transformer equation the transformer question is this equation that is going to let us extract some information given that we know some other information about relationship between free that is the robot days is at a given instant the end effector position could be computed with respect to the space now if we know where the end effector and if we are able to have that total relation then we can compute where the base is end in this relation Lady song very interested a property about this if you start from a and go all around walk all around and come back to a you should obtain a transformation homogeneous transformation that is equal to identity so we have any identity transformation when we walk from a and go all around and come back to it I'm using this we can say essential from HDD to cc2 bb20 if we multiply them be careful with the older you're going to eliminate all of this and you'll get a to a wishes event so now I don't what is missing let's say we are missing d2c then you multiply May the inverse of this from one side and the inverses of the others and eliminate and computers the transformation that unit that is here we have four transformations one of them is unknown then you can extracted and find it in the case app for computer A2B simply you are going to find that you go from A to B my HDD to C&C tube ok just and don't be confused I mean sometimes the transformations are not written in the right direction so you will use the in but you have always have to walk in the same direction and then you can say is entity a today and then you can compute any element that is a no ok when we're done with transformations any questions about transformations well I think you have a homework about that you will find out if you have question alright well now we are then the lowest point in spatial descriptions and this is the representation what do we mean by representation the questions that we concerned with is this squash we have descended and the end of Factor is really the purpose of the hole manipulation problem that we are concerned with how to position this in the factory in space and how to move it to some location so we need to say well our and the Factor is at some location x y and z and it has some orientation now it's not enough to say well I have a homework because this description we know we know the position and orientation it is embedded in the homogeneous transformation we know the relationship from the end of fracture to the base frame through and you're going to find that relate when we finish the follow kinematic when we complete the for kinematics you're going to be able to say my end-effector transformation to respect to the base is given by t and this the way come from the description of the manipulator so the link laying the angles 13 and characteristics of the of the lungs and also it will be functions of what what other parameters will be involved in so it is the manipulator moving at this configuration how can I compute this position and orientation I'm going to use this length and the angles and also I'm going to use come on I'm tired the Joy the Giant the John angles I need your tango what is variable what is changing as a movie he's going to be function of position that are constant depending on this manipulator and the joint Sooty will very with don't tangle so the configuration of the robot will affect where this end effector is going to be so we will be able to find the T as a function of the joint end and it will be a matrix 4 x and this Matrix was contain for each configuration the description of homogeneous transfer ok so at a given configuration we measure the intruders we read the intruders and then can't we can come to you tea and say my homogeneous transformation for the Factor is this now the question is where where is the position of the inter and what orientation the in the factory the question is important because not only concerned about positioning then two-factor I'm going later to move it following a treasure I need to think about the velocity so I need some description of coding that would give me like God in it then I can computer expert EventCity acceleration I need a set of coordinates ok so what we need to do then is to extract from tea the position description and the orientation District and say I have a description something like I have the position and I have the orientation I have set up alarm m x XP for the position and xr4 Lillian right because I cannot take tea and the thing to deliver to 50 and just say well I'm going to build a trajectory directly with d Johnstone so where can we find XP what is the environment where is the information about XP NT the first three element of the last column that's what you said correct because this is going to give you basically this this vector is in the transformation on the last column of so you can come to this one and that would be a description x y and z then the factor position what is the rotation at least where I can find information about the orientation NT yeah so it will be the first three columns corresponding to this our Matrix the rotation matrix in ok now how should I represent because you said I y and z but there are other possible representation so for the position I could say I think that position and it is represented by x y and z so this is the Cartesian representation but I can select this angles Theatre and the prediction of that on the plane XY and come up with a cylindrical vintage or I think that other angle and come up with a spherical present tell there are several way ways of representing that position and most of the time we will use Cartesian coordinates in cases like if you if you have a dexterous manipulation with a tool and you want to move in this Direction it might be more advantages to use electrical cord because your dog is a line directly with that vector and you can just extend the vector and move and the angles or fixed so you control them and just you move along that other representations are also very useful in different task for the ok well still in here we're talking about x y and z rotate order pizza pie always three parameter free independent farmers stop not much fun simple the fun starts when we think about rotation and that is where most of the difficulties with a beginner Maddox robot system slice in fact we're going to start to see some aspect of those the most problems will carry on all the time as we we start to consider instantaneous rotations instantaneous acceleration and their relations to representation the space of rotation is really different from the space of linear space of linear that is the space where we describe a position and we going to little by little see this problem so the 1st complete representation contains all the information about rotation is our rotation matter so in this rotation matrix everything is there about Dorian dish I have an object held in the interfactor basically there is a frame x y and z that is going to rotate with this object and if I take a Swansea frame and take its component with respect to the reference frame that would be my total rotation so from tea Amazon transformation I can't extract this rotation Matrix and in which I see that all 1 this is a vector this Nissan the component R1 r2r 3 all these three so our 1 is what in this frame if I take the x got actors r 1 represents what what is the definition of basic definition of rotation math we say that first poem is the component of Acts on the base frame I want is really the component of x artaud is the component of y&r 3 component of ok now I can build a representation with I can just say my XR this acts that is going to represent the rotations and the orientation of the intellect is simply the concatenation of R1 R2 R3 I take the free vectors and put them one on top of the eye R1 R2 R3 it's a long vector but this factor actually contains everything you need about orientation now obviously so do we need 94m metres to represent orientation obviously there is how many degrees of freedom we need how many parameters minimum number of parameters would be free I mean we have 3 degrees of freedom material 9 so how come how can we have nine play toddlers Beckett sonnet is already printed turn so we have sort of relations of normalization associated with R1 R2 R3 so this is 3 points straight we need more 9 - 3 what's till 6 I need three more ok so are one or two one constraints are two or three 1 constraints and or 3 or 1 360 let's check yeah you're right so 6 and you have 9 basically you have yet actually 3 degrees now this is a redundant representation redundant in the sense that the parameters we are using I'm not independent that creates a problem that is you cannot say what is the problem with that I don't know if you realise that the I think about emotion I'm going to I'm going to take this and rotate look like I mean I'm going to some water in so you have emotion so you have someone initial XR you have some final XR and you went to go from one to the next how can you create a trajectory you see the problem ok play think about another simple problem wishes I'm going to move from A to B a is defined by x a x y z a here XYZ be how can I move from this to this so x is equal 10 and 14 and 22 smoke and interpolate and every every point is valid ok no L interpolate xr1 I'm in the first configuration and the final configuration if you do the interpolation you will violate the US if you just deal in your car interpolation between you can not Take That they are not independent so you have to monitor what has happened it's very difficult to just work with this directly as x y and z what is happening with the rotation is that you are moving over a sphere SO3 in that space whereas XYZ are moving in the free space and you have to deal with this discounts so what other representations come off if we don't use the vectors associated with the frames what can we say about the train station there are bees angles what angles other angles are very very useful now there are many different ways in fact of talking about an angular representation the three angle representations I mean you can count maybe 24 of them we distinguish between other angles the fix angles that we use in aviation and each of them has like sort of 12 different represent and the dust representation come from the way we obtain this you have a frame and you're going to try to find the frame B and the relationship between the two using three so what do you do you have many options Kangoo this axis rotate about this axis and then what's your rotate about this access with some and then you can go and read it about this and then after you can come back to the same access and do the addition only go to 1/3 acts and so you have a maybe you can start from the y axis first that's why you have a lot of ways of doing but you'll end up always with three but you need to know which access your rotating on and weather after the first rotation you repeated about first access there is no problem some intermediate next you can get it about the new that resulting from the first rotation so this is like a rotation with respect to the brain created after the first rotation you can maintain Eurovision 3rd edition about fix act so we distinguish between 6 rotation fix angle rotation and that give us well and relative rotation give us another hello angles are the relative and the fix ones or the what we call fixed angle rotor select start from the beginning I'm going to go to this configuration bye putting the two friends together ok I'm going to rotate about The xx with a sum angle this is the first of these the new frame that results so the idea is I'm going to rotate from identical and then I'm going to get a first frame and then I will do another rotation and vegetation to this the final the Bee wishes in here so if the next rotation is done about the relative next axis why so from not be Prime I'm going to do another rotation about be Prime then this is sort of our angle represent and I have 12 set depending on the selection of if we do this next rotation on the blue the fixx one here I will obtain an intermediate one but when I continue this will give me the fix angle and you have 12 we will see that in fact every representation here has an equivalent representation so in total we do not have 24 different representations we have only 12 that could be represented of paint from relative access or fixed single ok so in total you have only 12 alright let's take an exam I'm going to take the rotation Z yx which means we will start with a rotation about the Z axis then why then and I'm talking about other angles which means relative British so here is the first rotation you're rotating about the Z axis ent the xbxb prime and YB prime are in the same plane as XA and Y and you have an angle alpha between those acts so the next rotation will take place about what about work and this is the new y the new y That resulted from the first route and we will call it a beta angle and now this relation is in the plane xb prime and zebra I am the final rotation will be about x and it will be of an angle gamma and it will be in the plane ybw Prime zbw and that will take us to be now I need to compute this transformation and I need to compute what is the rotation from frame by frame to frame a the transformation from frame be double prime to be Prime and the final transformation from B2 bdwp and if I have nose transformation I multiply them out I will find the total transformation good so that is what we want we want to compute this this this must come out you get Speedway well maybe before so what was the first transformation was x rotation about the X with an angle of gana I'm going to write rotation about x with an angle of gum the one before was rotation about y with the incubator and replace in about 0 with an angle Alpha you have your transformations so you take this so this is what this is 100 cosine the angama - cosine sine cosine and you you have your transformation you computer did you find euro so you'll get this transformation as a function of alpha beta and gamma and now for a given orientation you know the position in rotation space you say its alpha beta gamma how if we do it with fixed angles essentially we are going to do a rotation about about why about Z but no singles of done and invoice rotations are done about the fix actor in fact this is what we call the roll pitch and yaw and these are using aviation speaker you're you're doing small angle rotation in general this are very interested perceive what rotation you have made and the competition of the comes to be very simple if you think about the rotation x with the angle gamma that first rotation if you have a factory this vector is transformed by the rotation about x with this angle you you have an operator changing the factory to the vector RX gamma V and what the next transformation you take the result and transform it when rotation about why and the last one is going to apply the Lost transformation and when you put all these transformations you see that the total transformation is given by the product of x gamma Ry L and R C so this operators that we saw before are very useful and in fact when we look at this transformations essentially we are going to obtain the transformation directly from rotations about directly dosac so this apparatus are very simple because they are done about the x y and z and every one of them is like them operator about the is a rotation hear 001 about the Z axis with cosine - sine cosine the operator about why is rotation about the y-axis with this anger and this is the rotation about so if we do this multiplication you will obtain a matrix that is only function alpha beta gamma this I'm not showing the Returns because they are little big but basically I'm showing just this element and you can now do the product and find that match and now your rotation matrix is expressed as a function of alpha beta gamma let's go back to the beginning how do we compute the end effector position and orientation how do we measure we said we measured in cudas we use the following format to compute the homogeneous transformation and we know the rotation matrix in America now what we are saying it is this matrix is equivalent metrics computed with those free rotation so how can I find Alfreton what is Alpha what does beta what is Ghana this is really the problem the problem is I need to be able to compute these values and compute the values I need to find the inverse that is given the value of the mattress I need to compute those value this is another example here so here we have the yx the Matrix looks like this if you have the zyzz you'll get this other m so this 11 that are very simple so you know this element design beta you have the numerical value you identify two cosine beta and you can invert leader and find what is better for that for that specific configuration ok so if we take zyz representation what is the ingrown hair hello angles zzy x what is alpha beta and gamma check your have to remove vehicle can you think about it from here can you see it what is the which one is non-zero I mean I'm sure most of you already can you see it location we went to bed frame from the blue initially with a rotation about which acts best actress of an angle of what's 90 degrees UC everyone no confusion good ok send if we take fix anger and we take other angles I just am awaiting them together now the fix angles this is the relation we obtain the Bangles vs the relation and now a fuel look at the two you can see that the rotation about Ella rotation and fix rotations aura Dental that is the xyz Windows rotation gamma beta alpha is equal to the Z PrimeWire prime explant with alphabet for each rotation you have a corresponding rotation in the 12 end lol not the same the same equations have to be so now we come to the difficult problem the problem I mentioned earlier which is that how you obtain this alpha beta gamma how you clean your representation from your measurement so you are given the rotation matrix Limerick from your full of ketamine so you know our from b2a and the question is what is alpha beta gamma well I mean it's actually I need to identify a shower from B28 9AU r11 r12 r13 I need to identify them too the rotation matter so now you have the full match end you have 5-minutes so how do we do that I can help you if you need something obviously the distance are little bit too complicated this one and this one though let's see I have alpha beta here alpha beta and beta here I could use the so how cold can we compute Bader if we scored this and squares besides square and South square at 1 and I will get cosine beta Square so so I can get Hussain beta from the square root of this element Anderson right now we going to use on a function that we call the inverse of dependent to that takes to argue it takes the sine and cosine to compute the tents and that gives you a all the angles within there area so where can we find the sign of beta well we have the sign of beta here in this element element 31 it is - 0 it has to be mine so if I think this function and a place this here and here I cannot attain m now given that you're feeling better how can you compute will you go back to does Elena 11 and 1221 and you know beta so you can compute cosine and sine the problem that you're going to have is this problem which is that if you could sign beta becomes equal to 0 if Peter becomes equal to 0 you're going to have a poo and this problem is that you cannot divide anymore bye 0 so you have some men determination and this leads to a singularity recorded singularity of the representation we will see later kinematic singular real singularities the robot is moving and when it reaches this configuration the robot cannot move immediately industrial squat indus Direct like this this is a kinematic singularity and you will see this when we take the delivery the forward kinematic but in here this representation is fixed it's only you who selected this representation that you selected and mathematical model that fails at some fig so in this case when cosine beta becomes zero you can only determine the sum of Alpha and Gamma or alpha - gamma and the reason is when data is zero essentially the z-axis are aligned and you have a rotation in the same plane you do a rotation of Alpha then zero and Gamma so you are not able to distinguish between the Alpha and the game I think I have an example this is what happen if Cassandra is 0 the sign the sign of beta positive or negative the rotation is done in the same plane and all what you have is the alpha mine is coming add application or the alpha + Beta is negative so what does it mean and why is this a problem I mean obviously you see it mathematically but why this is a problem ok so you are going to use your parameters alpha and beta and you're trying to identify alpha and beta as you move because you are measuring and you're and you reach this configuration you have an under termination and at that moment you are not able to compute the velocity associated with alpha as we will see that the jacobian when we take the derivatives we we we have a singularity in that location and you are not able to track your mum so you cannot really determine the properties of the motion at that point and this is a problem if you want to move and smooth motion usually if you are doing a very tiny motion you might be able to select alpha and beta so that they will never go to zero within that small but if you are performing Lord Morrisons in space you are going to run into the singularity now we can change the presentation we can use another one but every single representation that uses 3 parameters is going to run into a singularity all 3 parameter representation will have a single letter to someone and that is the problem so 300 presentation has are efficient because they are minimal but they have a problem with the representation in term of the singularity of the representation Direction cosines are perfect internal the representation no singularities whatsoever however you have redundancy and you have to hang all these constraints as you plan your mush another derivative representation we can talk about little bit before talking about the best solution and this is a representation that you can think about just by going back to the problem moving from one frame to another train so you have friend you have friend and you can show that there is always a vector k about wish you can write it with an angle theta to go from a to that specific b so there is a rotation about a vector that will take you there so we can now think about a representation that uses k and data and this is the equivalent angle axis represent so how can you build your presentation you can say I'll take l ingredient I take the vector K I need to identify ka obviously but I can find Gate sky and Casey and then kill it with either in regions and that will give me three numbers representing my position and now I can what is nice you can interpolate and you can move and you can go between configuration no the rotation matrix associated with this is like this it involves both the key and the angle theta through co-sign signs and also one minus sign for this new variable you are given this measuring and you need to identify the element kxk ykz wish you can do through equations so you can compute your k by taking the difference and dividing by the sign of data and this is coming from identifying with the metre stop Oceania travel you have a singularity you can divide by 0 when is there so you have again the same proper so IC 9 is too much three doesn't is not going to work whatever I will do with three is not going to so what should we do 4 good let's try for well this is what actually hello parameters do they now take the same concert I think the Rapture I know I can do it without instead of taking the angle and skinning it I'm going to track correctly everything we'll talk about this in address robotics more in details about just like to give you the interest essentially we are going to take for Corona define promise I'm going to take w this unit vector is unit back and I'm going to scale it by half the sign of half of the angle theta and then I'm going to add another parameter which is just the cosine of her that so Epsilon 1 episode 12 episode 13 or just mega w the vector w scaled by fine I've have all the angle and the last parameter Epsilon for is just cosine half of the when you are a lot of freezers a lot of invitations for this at which you can see here is a lot of interesting properties that with that way of selecting the representation why unit vector sine square and cosine Square very nice property so now Epsilon is actor in four dimensional space that is you have this normality condition if you add the square of absolutes you get one and that has nice property that in the operators and carries to the derivatives and everything let me just tell you that again with this representation is song this represents representations of the problem but there are really many details related to the way we select representation the way we track and compute the absolute and win any of the parameters we are using to do the competition goes 20-something have so you have to be very careful about and if we analyse and try to identify you can see the relationship between the representation m and your and you can find out if you add the square of the diagonal it gives you 3 - for The Entity and this quantity between parenthesis is what is 1 - the missing parameter Square so you can do in computer spirometer and then you can compute everything else very simple again you are dividing by this parameter what happens if this parameters goes to zero so if this parameter is 20 actually some other parameters will not go to zero and because the property I mentioned that this is a unit vector in the hypersphere in 4 dimensional space we have a property that shows that Quran recitation at any time there is always one of the parameters that is equal equal means all of them are equal to one have to build one otherwise it's not possible or otherwise there is always one parameter that is large enough and then you can do the same competition using that parameter that is larger so the algorithm that we use is always to think about what is the largest parameter resolved with respect to that larger problem so as you repeat you are checking the larger parameter and you are resolving if if it is of someone you do you use this formula if it's something to you use this formula etc you can you can always resolve IT depending on which parameter is lock that hear you eliminate the singular no more singular so well we don't have time for the quiz what are the parameters for this example it's a relation about the x-axis will an angle 60 fine 30 so it will be x-axis is 100 sign 30 do you remember 1/2 so like this and the cosine what's 30 that's your problem and what is the corresponding Direction cosine represented the first one is going to be 100 and then you get the sine and cosine of the angle Rightwell with that I can believe so have I nice break and I will see you that was it
