chloroquine her deadline section tomorrow we're going to go through the backpropagation example which I went through very briefly in the last lecture talk about us neighbours which I did win one minute and also going to talk about a cycle on which is it is really useful 204 doing machine learning which might be useful for your final project good to know so please come to section do a little bit of review of where we are so we talk about we're talking about machine learning supervised learning where we start with feature extraction we take examples and convert them into a feature vector which is more amenable for only agreed on we can take either predictors are neural networks which gives us scores and the scores either defined via simple dot product between a white actor and the feature vector or some sort of more than phenol in your combination the end of the day we had these motor family that gives us your score functions which then can be used for classification regression we'll talk about what functions as a way to assess the quality of a particular predictor so in linear classification we had this year on lost and the hinge loss as example of what functions that we might care about the training loss is an average over the losses on individual examples of this we can use the stochastic gradient algorithm which takes an example XY computer gradient on that particular example and then just updates no the weight that so hopefully this review ok so now I'm going to ask the following question philosophical so what is the true objective of machine learning so how many of you think it is to minimise the error on a training set no one that's what we've been talking about right we've been talking about minimising around training that's ok well maybe that's that's not right then what about minimising with regulation because station what about are minimising Air on a test app seems like it's closer right maybe you care about what about minimising Iran unseen future examples ok so the majority of you think that the right answer and what about the learning about machines the minimising error on unseen future examples so I think you have an intuition that we are doing some washing on turn on data but we really care about is how this predictive performs on in the future because we're gonna play this in a system and it's going to be the future it's going to be on the scene and then but then ok so then how do we do think about all these other things no training said rotation test so that's going to be something will come back to you later so the question is like well this little it's supposed to be really wanted to just minimiser training us what will we do well here for you so you just story examples ok and then you're going to define your projector is as follows so if you see that particular example in your training then you're just going to put it out the output out where you saw in a training set otherwise using phone crash right so this is great it minimises the train so what's the formula for the licence of love and how do we assess whether predictor is because we can't measure it we can't really optimiser cancel the key ideas and we really care about error on unseen future examples ok so this is great as you know aspiration to write down but the question is because it's the future it's also unseen so no I definitely we can get a candle get a handle on this so typically what people do is and the next thing which is a test set which is supposed to be representative of all the types of things you would see and then you got it carefully and make sure you don't touch it too much right because know what happens if you start looking at a test at the worst case that you train on a task right so the test being a surrogate for unseen future examples goes away and even if you start looking at you can get into this over feeding regime be careful that the size that the test circuit for when you actually care about so don't believe me just try to make test numbers cost ok so but for now let's assume we have our tested so we have to work with no this time right 4qu thing about machine learning which is this leap of Faith by you the 20 hour them is only operate on a training set and then all the sun and you go to these on singing apples or the test and your expected to do while so no why is there why would you expect that what happened on the first day of class there some kind of actually pretty deep for mathematical reasons for why this might happen but no run again into the matter I just want to give you a picture of how to think about this this can also remember we had this picture that it's of all predictors so these are all the functions are you possibly one in your wildest dreams and then when you define a feature extractor or an architecture or any sort of have no structure you basically saying hey I'm only interested in these set of functions functions text Anna learning is trying to find some element of the class of functions of that you are fine ok so there is a decomposition which is used so let's take this point you so g is going to be the best function in this class the best predictor that you can possibly so if some oracle came and set your know now awaits to something how well could you do what is the difference between us are witches that the true predictor so this is the thing that always gets the right answer and G which is the best thing in your class play second part is estimation error this is the difference between the best thing in your hypothesis class and the function actually find this measures how good is a learn predictor and relative to the potential that I got this quite you divide this hypothesis classes things I'm willing to consider but this time you you can't get your some you do a learning and you get some of that so any kind of warm mathematical terms if you look at the error of the thing that you're a lorry out of actually Returns - the area of the Nebraska impossible which place is then this can be written as follows so I'm doing is minor subtracting and adding so this is the same quantity as this but then I can look at these two terms for the estimation errors the difference in between other things that you're lonely album producers - the best thing and classed you and then the difference approximation errors the difference between a refugee and error other half star so this is going to be useful as a way to hand conceptualize the different trade-offs so you know just a little bit suppose I increase the hypothesis class size right so I am more features or I know added increase The Dimension of my own networks what happens so the approximation are well go down and why is that because we're take a minimum of largest so I'm always the minimum possible over this setup they make the cell larger I just more possibilities of driving better down but the estimation as I make my hypothesis class more expressive and that's because it's harder to estimate something more complex only be a kind of a vagrant Alders mathematical way to phone Oasis which you can ask me about offline so you can see this kind of tension here but you really want to make you a hypothesis class so you can drive down the approximation error but you won't like a two large that it becomes impossible to estimate ok so now we have discount abstract framework water some jobs we can turn how do we control the size of the hypothesis so we can talk about two eccentric classes of types of ways so strategy one is dimensionality so remember for linear classifiers a predictor is specified by a wave actor so this is die numbers we can change the we can make this smaller by removing features we can make the larger by adding feature and petroli you can think about as reducing Diaz reducing the dimensionality of your of your class so if you're in three dimensions year 3 numbers 3 degrees of freedom you have this kind of dimensions now you have this circle in two dimensions ok so can't really what this means is you can manually add a no this is a lot better respect you can add features if they seem to be in your helping remove features of their own so are you going to modulator of dimensionality of your Factor there are also automatic methods such as outside the scope of this this class on more about this and the stock but the main point is that you can determine by setting the number of features you have you can very expressive ok so the second strategy is looking at the norm or the norm or the light of AKA your obvious so again predictors the weather is just and you look at how long factorise so what is the line pictorially looks like that so if you have let's say all the wave actors in SW community as well so this circle contains all the are Wave actors up to a certain length and if by making a smaller and now you're considering a smaller number of cancel that loads perhaps intuitive so what is this actually look like so let's suppose we doing one-dimensional the board and what are looking at that's why so remember what in one dimension overlooking at is no we just a single number right and the number represents the slope of this line so by saying I don't know let's try some slow so by saying that the weight vector or the weight is small Manitou that's basically saying the slope is smaller but it is 0 so if you think about this is so so so anything anything That's what someone or greater - 1 is that ok and reduces to half now you're looking at a smaller window here and if you keep on producing now you basically conversion to a very flattering constant functions so you can understand this two ways one is just at the total number of possible way back cos you're considering it's just drinking because you're putting more constraints they have to be your smaller from this picture you can also think about it as what you're really doing is making the function no smoother right because a flat function is a function it doesn't vary too much and complicated functions in one that you're very jump up and your forehead quadratic functions can also come down very quickly so you can kind of very wiggly functions tend to be more complicated any questions about this so far yeah like that distributions have instead of must complex something normal mother come from something reasonable naturally Catherine before full xchocobars sorry the question is if there is particular structure inside your data Jersey Boys something's are sparse or floor anchor something how do you catch that with a red Rising station but you have inside how are you yeah so so all this is kind of very generic but you're not making any assumptions about the what the classifier is are in the future's so they're kind of like big cameras that you can just reply so if you have models where you have more structure terminology on which will see you know for example that works later and a class then there's much more and you can't this is just kind of know two techniques for as a camera generic way of controlling the feeling this approach that Lincoln Street yeah so so let's look at your in 3-dimensions so we was W1 W2 W3 I'm so the first message it says ok let's just kill some of these elements make it smaller this one is saying that I mean formulates looking at the squared values of each of these and looking at the square root that's so it's saying that usually it should be nice small according to this particular network but the most popular way is to add regularisation and my regularisation what I mean is take your original objective function which is a train loss of wny just add this penalty term soul and it is called a regulation strange it's just a positive number what's a what's a one and this is the squared length of w ok so what is a serious by Alan it's saying that ok optimizer you should really how to make trailers small but you also try to make this ok and they're so if you so convex optimisation there's kindest between the Grand in form where you have a pen Eliza Jack Avery add a penalty on the way back and warm where you just say that I want to minimise trimata with subject to the norm of WB last and some value but this is more than kind of typical one that you're going to see in in practice ok so whose objective function great how do I optimise yeah yeah so it's important that these be the same w and you're optimising the song so the atomizer is going to make these trade-offs if it says ok I can drive the train lines down but if this is shooting off then that's not good and I'll try to balance this too it's basically saying tried to fit a door but not at the expense of having huge with doctor's if there's another way to say it is at ok so what do you have this objective we have a standard crank we can turn to turn this into out when you can just do gradient descent and the new if you just take the derivative of this then you have this gradient and then you also have a Lambda w which is the gradient of this term so you can understand this is basically you're doing great understand as we were doing before and now are you doing is your shrinking the way to towards zero by land if it's Lords that means you're trying to really and push down on the magnitude of waves is basically going to say hey I'm going to try to step in a direction that makes the training last small but then I'm going to also not push the weights towards zero Armin no nuts lyrics this is also known as so I'll wait ok and automation and statistics it's because this is the Euclidean norm ok so here it here is another strategy which I'm intuitively get the same idea but it's in some sensor in your more crude so it's got really stopping and is very simple you just stop really instead I'm going in training for 104 50 so why why does why is this a good idea on the intuition is that if you start with a weight of 0 so that's the smallest you can make an alarm of w right so every time you update on the training so sad generally the norm goes up there's no guarantee that always go up but generally this is what happens so if you stop early that means you you're giving lots of opportunity for them to your grow grow so few updates translate to generally lower in one you can also make this for my mathematically but you know the connection is not as tight as the explosive regulation from the previous line so the lesson here is your try to minimise the training error but don't try hard question hands on how are you guys the wait most of the time Ganesh Allies the weights from you're some sort of Weight Watchers Hanover based on zero or no for an answer maybe like on random vectors around 0 but they're pretty small weights and usually the weights grow from outside from small to large there's other cases where if you think about free training are you have a 3 time I'll you start with somewhere is and then you do gradient descent from that then you're saying basically don't go too far from your your initialisation right other cousins why are we focus on minimising the train lost my focus on W it's always going to be a combination so that it is still trying to push updates I noticed that the gradient with respect to the red rice actually doesn't come in here it kind of comes and explicitly through the fact that you're stopping at always going to the balance between minimising the training loss and also making sure your class classifier wait doesn't get through yeah yeah so the question is how you decide about your teeth here and how you decide of outlander so I prefer mirrors and I'll talk later ok so you're so kind of the general philosophy you should try to minimise it's raining because really that's the only thing you can do that your data and that's you have your data there but you should try to do so in a way that keeps your hypothesis small so trying to minimise the train instead but don't try too hard ok so now going back to the question earlier if you noticed all these on my presentation there's there's all sorts of properties of the learning algorithm which feature which regulation primary have the number of iterations the step size for gradient descent consider hyperparameters so so far they're just magical values that are given to the learning algorithm in the Lonely hour but someone has to set on and how do you set up yeah you can ask me I don't know the answer to that ok so here's an idea to minimise the trainer so have you think that's a good idea so why is it a bad idea error in the the learning algorithm says well ok no I won't go down what is this doing in the way that just said 20 and then I don't have to worry about that so it's got no cheating anyway and also early stopping with a light on start just keep on going because you're always going to drive the training lower and lower ok so that's not so how about Tuesday haparanda to minimise the tester how do you say yeah good idea yeah not not so good it turns out so why is it a girl stressing that point that the test is not a thing you care about because what happens when you look at it I will try to use a sad then it becomes unreliable pasta met of the actual on Cena because if you're tuning hyperparameters on a test that that means that it's no longer to becomes lots and lots on scene and Lost Future ok so I want to emphasise is fine when you're doing your final Project you have your test add you have a sitting there and you should not be feeling better too much or else it becomes less reliable ok so you can use a sad so what you do so here is idea behind the validation set is that you take your training set and you sacrifice some amount of it maybe it's your 10% maybe 20% and you use it to estimate the test so this is a validation set the test there is no off to the side as watching a safe and then you're just going to cameras on the validation set newsletter guide euro model development usually it's how you choose it is time does balance between you order validation set to be large enough so give you reliable one to use most of your data for training yeah so how do you choose a high pram m saw the the answer is you try particular values oh so you put temple try that a land record points for a while PT 11 and then you run out and then you look at your validationerror and then you just choose the one that has the lowest is pretty just doing like try this one is there a better way to search for hyperparameters you could do a search generate random sampling as there's plenty of things based on bayesian optimisation which might give you some benefits but it's actually the doors out on that in the more complicated there's also you can use better than your last sensitive to the stepsize so you'll have to know is like 0.1 works but 11 doesn't so you don't want that but there's no arm real kind of printable way of like here's a formula equals you just because this is 30 sided machine that needs to happen to get results so the question is is this process automated increasingly it becomes much more automated so it requires a fair amount of computer because usually the other largest even training one mole on my take all the while and now you're talking about your training that's 100 models so can be very expensive than those things that you can do to make it faster but I mean in general I would advise that don't hyperparameter tuning can blindly especially when you're kind of learning the ropes of manually my intuition for what a step size effect of size and still valuable to have and then what you can get a hangover maybe you can order me but I wouldn't try to order me too early is that yeah so question is if you change a high pressure is a little bit and that causes you are training or model performance to change quite a bed does that mean your mph robust means your model was probably not as robust and sometimes you actually don't use hyperparameter and you still give them no more performances so yours always check that first because there could be just inherent randomness especially if you're doing no network could get stuck in local optimum there's all sorts of things that can happen now so how do you choose optimal hyperparameter so you basically have ik4 look that says 4.1.0 11 and whatever values 40 = of something you train on this all the string examples - Aldi and then you test the model on the validation you get a number and you just used whichever setting gives you the lowest number do you know the numbers yeah usually you just have to be in the bob you don't have to get like a 99 vs 100 the things I would just advisors no that's a what can orders of magnitude because if it if it really matters like being down the precise number then you probably have other things to worry about what I'm going to do now is go through a cannabis sample problem because I think that the theory of machine Ariana practices are actually quite different in terms of the types of things that you have to think about this simplify named entity recognition problems and named entity is this recognition is this why popular task in and I'll pay when you're trying to find names of people and locations and organisations so the input is a string where which has your particular potentially name with the last and write contacts words and to predict whether that contains either a person plus one or not so sure when you're doing your final project or something and you get a dataset it have it hasn't been Ora split split it into training validation and test and walk the test way and then first I would try to look at the data to get on your intuition always remember you want to make sure that you understand I don't start kodi off the most you can think of and then you repeat you implement song no feature may be changed architecture of your network and then you turn some programmers and you run and then you look at the the training and validation error rate to see your how they're doing if you're under fitting overfitting in some cases you can look at the weights for a linear classifiers Inferno netting might be a little bit harder and then you I would recommend look at the predictions of your model always have I was try to log as much information as I have you cancel that you can go back in understand with them all those you're trying to do and then you bring some some improvements and you can do this until you either or happy or you run out of time and then you run on the final test and you get your final price would you put in your report ok so let's go through an example of what this might look like so this is going to be based on the code base for the sentiment homework so so curious weather starting we reading a training set what's look at this training set so there are 7000 lines each line contains 2 label which is - 1 + 1 along with the input which is going to be remember the last contest the action entity the right context so you also have a developmental validation set what does it's going to learn a predictor which text the trainers and a feature extractor which were gonna fill out I'm going to help put about the weights and some analysis which can work used to look at the predictions and finally there's his test which I'm gonna not ok so the first thing is what's define this feature extractor so this feature structure is fear and we're going to use this parts your mouth representation of features a fee is there's this really nice or so this is kind of like saying you have a map but you can access it ok Sophie ok so this is the simplest feature of actor you can come up with the dimensionality is 0 because you have no teeth so f*** yeah we can run this and see how we ok so let's run ok so over number of iterations on you can see that long as I'm doing it because there is no wait stop ok so but it doesn't crash which is good ok so I'm getting 70% error which is very bad but I haven't done anything so that's true so now let's start to finding some ok so remember what is ask something like talk Mauritius rights of others select breakfast so I'm going to tokens = Excel split so that's going to give me and then I'm going to define laughed at 80 right equals so this is talking 0 is the truck tokens 1/3 - 1 is going to be everything until the last so can then talk it's my this one as the last one ok so now I can define a future tense remember a nice way to find so I can just say entity is blank that's how it would have right written as a feature template in code this is actually pretty transparent it's saying I'm define you feature which is going to be one for this is going to be sometime I get a particular feature value of your name and I'm going to set that your name to you have a picture that you want so let's run this queso sorry here so entity is a list so I'm just going to turn into a string ok so now I'm getting what happened so the the training is April alright basically fit in the training the trains are pretty well but now I don't care about the trainers are carried out the test just one it says test here but it's really the validation change that it's just whatever 9trane said you passed them ok so this morning remember I want to go back and look at song you'll get some inspiration for what's going on here so what's look at the ok so this is the weight vector that's learnt so this way future the waders and all these are one this no corresponds to the names that the people names that have been seen at because when I was here first name them going to do on no give that one so I can get that alright if you look at the bottom these are the entities which are not people to check that it's doing what it's on you're supposed to do so internal features that you can kind of are most computer waterway should be in your in your head yes I have one feature for every entity which is almost your number 3900 so we're going to change the what will get cancel this shows you choose an example of what a Romero on the ground truth is positive for we predicted -1 and what are we predicted -1 it's because this feature has 100 because we never saw his name add ringtone I would you do if that's alright we sorted it out training time and we predicted that was -1 ok but no you look at you say ok well you know this is maybe the we should have more features so if you look remember this your example here give me the contact helps right because if you have governor blank than you probably know it's a person because only people can know so bad a future so I'm going to add a future witches our last is left for symmetry I'll just add right is right so this is your features on know the contact so in this case will be looking into ok so now 350 tablets let's go and train this model and now I'm down to I just 11% so I'm making some progress let's look at the analysis play tsunami this correct let's look at what else am I doing wrong source Middlesbrough Felix mantilla and hasn't seen this exact actually did see the string before that So Gone yo I think there is a general intuition know that well if you have Felix you're even a bit you've never seen for you I can tell her if you see if you like something you know chances are probably as a person not always but as your notice before features are not meant to be like the Terminator crow serious piece of information which are useful so let's go over here and we want to define that's a of feature for every possible world that's in in entity the word entity remember entity is a list of tokens which occurred between left and right I'm going to say entity contains word now let's run this again and now I'm down to 6 percenter you'll better if you look at the air analysis can you make 6 apple an hour get this right and what else what else can so know what I'm kind of this general strategy here I'm following here is no which is not always the right one but you start with very very specific features and then you trade account generalize as you go so how can I generalise this more so if you look at work circular star right if a word ends in Stan then I mean maybe it's last flight into a person I actually don't know you're maybe it's like suffixes and prefixes I'm going to add features entity contains prefix and then I'm gonna love you for tokens suffix the last for tokens and then this again and now I'm down to 4 percenter ok I'm probably gonna stop right now at this point you can actually run on your test set we get 4% as well oh yeah I guess this was all planned out so that would go down but Ashley more often than not you are a feature that you really really think should help but it doesn't help for whatever reason so turn the living room light yeah you you yeah some of the time you it doesn't move that's kind of problems other time but sometimes ok if you had a really don't consider what features you add generally the 20 or will go down driving training doesn't know that it doesn't generalize so this is definitely the happy path I think when you go and actually do with machinery it's going to be more often than not the tessera wall not go down so don't get too frustrated on are you expected to optimise after 5% on it it really depends on your there is kind of unlimited everyday so they have no eyes sometimes you should definitely not optimise below the noise one thing that you might imagine this for Chapel you have an oracle which of that say it's human agreement I give you a dataset is anything about humans and humans came in really likes me for Summertime then you can't really do better than 7 time as a general exception happier oh yeah what happens if you accidentally you try on the test and it's not good that's you just say that is not good so many things I Could Happen what is that your test and my actually be different for whatever reason maybe was collected in a different day you live performance Just doesn't hold up on that tested in that case well that's your test right remember the test if you do look at it it's really honest representation how good this morning and it was not good well that's just a true that wasn't your mother is not that good in some cases the song like fog like something was Miss processed in a way and it wasn't right there so you know there are cases where you want to like investigate it's like way after Markiplier gone like 70% then maybe something was wrong and you would have to go investigate but if it's in a ballpark and whatever it is that's kind of what you have to do right so what you want to do is make sure you validationerror is kind of Representatives of your if your test there so that you don't have no Surprises at the day I think fine to run on a task I'm just too make sure that there's no catastrophic aggressive tuning something against yeah you should split the data into train that what percentage do you need to split into Ryan validation depends on how large you have generally people shuffle the data and then randomly split it into task validation and train maybe let's say like a present 10% my case is where you don't want to do that those cases where are you for supper one to train on the past and test on the future because Dad simulates the more realistic settings remember the test that is meant to be represented as possible of the situations that you in a real world 7000 all the do you have to do that I'm so question is the data site was labelled their 7000lri personally do not like this I said this is a senator said that someone no sometimes these days has come from your car breakers sometimes it come from experts on yeah sometimes they come is actually a good exercise to go and I've labelled alive data also in my life yeah ok let's go on so switching gears now let's talk about unsupervised order so so far contains input alcaparras so you given the input and this is output at your predictive output but this is a time where we just talk about how fully labelled data is very expensive to obtain because 10000 is actually not that much or you can often have no 100000 million examples which you do not want to sitting down and entertain yourself so the train today only contains imports and there is much cheaper in certain situations so for example doing text classification you have a lot of text out there people write a what are the internet and you can easily download your gigabytes of text and all that is on mobile and I can do something with that that would be no that it's gold or something and also images videos on and so on yeah it's not always possible to obtain on mobile data for somebody have you know some device that is producing data and you'll have one of that device that you've got yourself and you know you're not that much do that but you do have you want to do something arm so here's some examples I want to show it this is a classic of example from NLP that goes back to the early 90s so it does ideas work you give have a bunch of Rod text what a news articles and you put into this album which I'm not going to describe but I'm going to look at we can look at it so what is this output eat Returns a bunch of clusters where for each cluster has a certain set of words can you look at the classes the pretty cool here so this is roughly first class through his days of a week 2nd Class 2 months some sort of materials first class areas of synonyms of and no one wants the critical fine now it is that the employee was just write text know where did someone say hey this these are days of the month and I'll go text you later it's all unsupervised it's actually a person out the kind of the example when I was doing a masters the Gummy into doing NLP research because I was looking at this is like well you can actually take on my birthday Diane actually mine really interesting kind of Signals more recently others these factors which do something very similar instead of clustering words they in bed words and into a vector space so if you zoom in here each word is associated with a particular position and are words which are similar actually happened to be close by in back of space of country names these are pronouns desert yeah yours Monson someone so there's also contextualize were Victorians like on a few of those things which have been really taking another community by Storm on on my vision side you also have the ability to do on supervised learning so this is example from 2000 15 where you run Equestria Girls name which is also jointly learning the features in the Sky network identify different types of digits 0 and 9 and 4 is that look like nines or find that look like trees and someone classification right you're not tell me the Avalon Peugeot 5 series is just looking examples and finding the structure that so these are kind of the same thing and these are all the same thing sometimes but not always these clusters actually corresponds to labels and here's another example of shapes I'm playing and birds that look like planes so you can see this is not doing qualification it's just kind of looking at visual similarity alright so the general idea behind supervised learning is add-on lot of Rich construction and we want to develop methods I can discover the structure you automatically so there's multiple types of unsupervised learning is clustering dimensionality reduction but we're going to focus on in particular k means clustering for this lecture ok so let's get into a more formal so the definition of clustering as a follows I give you a set of points to ex12 excel you want to help put an assignment of each point to a plasterer in a Simon variables are going busy once every data point I'm going to have a z that tells me which other k clusters I'm in early you can kind of see maybe there's a last plaster over here and the broadcast over here we formulate that can mathematically so choose the payment objective function so this is the principle by which were going to derive class drinks and says that every 1:45 cluster is going to be discussing with a central in the space along with I'm going to associate each of the points with a particular so I'm going to do this by a blue arrow pointing from the point into the centroid and your face two quantities are going to have a represent the clustering I have the locations of the classrooms and red and also the Simon's of the points into the Clutches in envelope so of course neither the red or the blue who are known and that's something we can have to optimise queso but first we have to define what the optimisation objective function is so into it if we what we want we want each point your backside to be close to the sun for the central to be really represent of lack of the points and I crossed through that so should be close all the point in that cost you so this is this objective function where I look at all the points for every point I measure the distance between that point and the centroid that point is associated with is a number between one and so that indexes which of the new you want a Mewtwo I'm popping out and looking at the square distance between those two point how does each point get to assign to a central so that's one to be specified by the these which is going to be after my silver you don't know good evening to you how how many classes do you know how many clusters there are on in general down so there are ways to select is another hyperparameter so it's something that you have to set before you run the commands and functions so I'm when you're turning you try different number of clusters and see which one can it works better ok so we need 8 use the centuries and assignment so this is clear you just want to find the Simon's V&A Centre to make this number as small as possible so how do you do this well let's what's a simple one-dimensional example and lots of Four Points and the points are at there going to be at 0 to 10 and 12 so I have a points4 points at these locations in Italy you think I want to close this year There's Gonna Be to Central suppose I know the centroid ok so just someone told you magically that the centroid is at 1 and someone told you that and now you have to figure out the Simon's and how would you let's assign this point where should I go you look at this distance which is why you look at this distance which is 11 which are smaller one is smaller see you say ok that's why I should go with this point one is smaller for this 11 is smaller so you can see it's comparing the distance from each point to each of the centres and choosing a centre of which is closest can you can convince yourself that that's the way to if the cluster centres were sent to affects how you would minimise the objective function because of you choose a central which is further away than you get just about you and you want to be a smallest possible I don't know why this is true I think ok so let's do it the other way now suppose I now have the Simon's so I know that these two should be and some Kwacha these two should be in a different class were closer to and I had to place the percentages where where shall I pace if you look at the what you're doing is you're saying ok for the first class 90 2 and 0 signs that plasterer and I know that the sum of the distances to this the centroid of new is this and I want this number to be a smallest possible if you do the first homework you know that you know when you're free have one of these kind of squared up some of Jack loves you should be average in the points so you can actually Close form and you given the Simon's here you know that central should be there which is the average of 0 and 2 and 4 this this cluster you should average the 2.0 and I should be at what's the difference between centroid and a Simon so when you're clustering you have a cake classes so there's k centroids so this case there's two centroids there is the red or the association between the points and a central so you have an assignment yes ok here is a hyperparameter which is number for plasterers which you can turn ok so here's the chicken and egg problem right if I knew the centroids I could pretty easily come up with assignments if I knew the Simon's I could come up with the centroids but I don't know either so how do I get so the key idea Furious ultra minimisation which is general idea in optimization which is usually not a bad idea and the principles while you have a heart problem maybe can solve about tackling time to easy problems here so here's the k-means algorithm so I'll step one is you're going to you're giving a centroids now can't go any more general notation new model UK and I want to figure out assignments so for every data point I'm going to sign that data point to the cluster with the closest so here I'm looking at all the classes 12k and I'm going to test how far is that point from that centroid and just going to take the smallest value and that's going to be where I assign that point tattoo sleeping around your giving the class assignments now as you want and I will try to find the best scent so what sentence should I take so now you go to each question once ok and you're going to set the centroid of the cake last year to the average of the points assigned to cluster medically this looks like that you just some over all the points I which have in a sign to Classic a uru biscuit add up all the factors and then you just divide by the number things you supriya together if you want to automize this objective the kidneys reconstruction first you initialise new album UK randomly there's many ways to do this and then you just iterate set a timer to giving the classes centroids and then set the centroids given the assignments cialis make sense like-for-like images where like if you read in a similar way by bicycle like the words where where is there a spell totally differently can have same like how do you activate the map them to make a save location do Costa yeah so the question is like maybe for images distances in space and makes can work more sense but if you have words than no two words which you shouldn't be looking at like the distance between the words and two large look very different but there is somehow similar so this is something that word vectors no address which one are you talk about basically you want to capture the representation of a word by its context so the context and wish big and large occur is going to be kind of similar and you can construct his contact back to his dad give you a better representation pick it up tomorrow any other questions about the general can you get stuff and then yeah so this is going up to a fixed number of iterations t typically have some swords newborn monitor this object and one set are gets below soft changing very much then you just stop I'm actually there's a the k-means algorithm is guaranteed to always converge to a local ok so here I have a bunch of points so this is a JavaScript Emma you can go in play random change the point if you want it's linked after the course website and then I'm going to run to ok so initialised with these three centroids and these regions are a basically the points that would be a sign to that this is a venn diagram centroids and this is the last hunting which hopefully should be going down ok so now I iterate so in reaching one I'm going to sign the points 2 are the classes so these get h to blue the Swan get a sound ready to green and then the step 2 is going to be automize in the CW so giving all the Blue Point I'm put a centre in the snack in the middle of these blue tights with green and red noticed that now these points are in the region so if I re-assign then these become red and then I can iterate and then keep on going you can see that I'll be there eventually you're converges to a clustering where are these points are blue these points are red these are green are and if you keep on running as you're not going to make any progress because if assignments don't change then because of sentence so let me excuse I was just going to do on a boring but I think you can have that idea so let's talk about this a local minimum problem so can you just not guarantee is is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum but is not guaranteed you can find a global minimum so if you think about this is a visualisation of the objective function in your back going downhill you can get stuck here but it won't to that point so I just say you are 4 different random seeds you cannot say you initialise here ok so now all the three centres are here in if I run this in a run this now I get this other solution which is actually a lot worse remember the other one was 44 and this is 114 and that's where I'm going some practice people typically try different initialisations running from different random points and then just take the best there's also a particular way of initialisation called caymans plus plus where you put down a point and you put down a point which is a spider subway as possible and then as far as possible and then that kind of spread out of Santa's so they don't interfere with each other and that generally works pretty well but still there is no Nestle guarantee of conversion to Largo Bolton on any questions about time how do you do skinhead love these hybrid premier Training questions so one thing you can kind of bra is so ok boss that you get from k and usually if you have one plaster the losses can be very hard and that at some point it's in your going to go down and you generally laugh it off when it's not going down very much that's another thing you can do is you have a validation set and you can measure reconstruction error on the new validation said Tuesday minimum bass song that is just another how's the training last calculated so the training loss is this quantity so you some over are you your points and then you look at the the distance between the point and the sign Central Square that and you just an old that's never loved ok so the wrap up Oh Actually I haven't you have more slides here unsupervised ineo trying to Leverage a lot of data and we can can't get around this difficult optimisation problem by doing this afternoon minimization so these will be quick so just too kind of sunrise the learning section we talk about feature extraction and I want you to think about the hypothesis class that's defined by a set of features prediction which what sounds can what kind of man are you looking at for classification and regression supervised learning you have linear models in your networks and fork Australia have injective functions which your mini case is all you need to do is computer gradient and then there's channelization which arm is we talk about for the first half of this like sure which is really important to think about your the Tessa remembers can ammonia surrogate for on some Future examples so a lot of these ideas that we presented or actually quite so I live at least squares for regression goes back to you no gas when he was trying to sort some astronomy problem but just rushing was from statistics why there was actually some learning I was done even though you're in the 50s of her playing checkers element in the first day of class there is a period were learning canakkale favour but it came back with back propagation in a match of the 90s actually a lot more rigorous treatment of optimisation and formalization of one that that happened in and then I'm in a 2000 that people look like structure prediction and there's a revival neural networks something that we haven't covered or your feedback Loops right so learning as soon as Kinder static you were you take data you tomorrow and then you go in general predictions but if it's a real world predictions are actually gonna come around and big data and feedback Loops can also cause the problems that you might not be aware of if you're only think about I'm doing my machine running time your how can you build classifiers that don't discriminate so we Python have class in minimising the training said average of a train so bye-bye kind of construction you're trying to drive down the loss of no comment but haven't you get this situation for minority groups actually had a pretty high loss because they look different and almost looks like outliers but you're not really able to fit them but the training loss doesn't kind of no car so there is other ways those techniques like distributionally robust optimisation that try to you'll get around some of these there's also privacy concerns can you learn actually if you don't have access to entire dataset so there's some techniques based on randomisation I can help you and then inter mobility how can you understand what no the algorithms are doing especially if it covered if no network if your name on all your work at which I am happy to discuss so the general so we concluded 3 letters on machine morning but I want a you kind of to think about learning in the most generally possible which is that your program should improve with experience right about pacifiers and all these kind of nuts and bolts of basically reflex models but in the next lotteries were going to see how learning can be used in Staples models and also know very well ok with that so that concludes on next week or daughter will be giving a lecture on CBS models
