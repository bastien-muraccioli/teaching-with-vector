the we get started continue on Becca space model Focus especially today on traduction look a whole family of model production can't understand what they're doing and how are they related to each other and so forth for a second I was thinking that your timing for everything this week would be that we actually finished this slideshow like Midway through glass on Wednesday because what I'd love to do is just create some space in here how to do hands on work with The Notebook especially with the homework because it would be wonderful if you all left you're on Wednesday feeling like my setup you can renew the rules of the game quickly run through the homework problems and get thinking about your original system that's the ideal dance against the fact that I don't want to rush particular their questions from people last for they were very perceptive and kind of pushed us in just the right direction so I certainly don't want you to feel your hands because we're not infected Dr we have to balance this precious would like to create some space for hands-on problem-solving cos I think that's really rewarding and we have a lot of the teaching team available to help you out that you have exactly the moment you have it and I think environment for learning Leatherhead a few other announcements so we have a very accomplished teaching team lots of different kinds of expertise and a bunch of them have volunteer to do kind pictures are units that we sprinkled throughout the course add various thing so that's the first one yeah the first one comes on May one at the end of our unit on natural language inference which is Arfa really big labelled datasets talk to us a bit about lifelong learning and I'll let him on pack that term for you but he's done a lot of work under that rubric that's kind giving you some interesting machine learning insights and also maybe connecting with things from cognitive science timed and then a little bit later in the term when we talk about metrics and methods frontier to think about kind of a next phase of that where we move beyond precision recall accuracy time kind of things and really thinking a serious way about what it means for a system to generalise in a useful way and a real problem and kind of introspect on what the systems are actually learn I'll be exciting in that nicely time when we talk about contextual representations in this class talk about the mod China focused on how the you're preaching representations can be used as tools that would improve you're doing for your project that's going to be my counterparts another very familiar thing that might improve your systems Which is longblob of text like a whole article with some kind of keys of contacts for the prom you want to talk about what's an effective way to turn that big blob of dimensional dance representation that you could use for another 22 again in the Spirit of just helping you get moving in interesting directions on your project about data augmentation which is I guess like making maximal use of the data you have available to you you guys are thinking about actually writing up and presenting your work about new tech Mr kind of pro what might be a black box model to figure out what it's learn dating just for us someone who wants to understand your own system but also of course that's wonderful stuff for a discussion or error analysis section where we cannot get a higher level inside beyond the numbers into what your decided by the sequence of things cos I think this is getting really nicely compliment the core Strand of work that we plan to talk about lots more to come and relatedly the Friday session and Python in jupyter notebooks that was great who participated the video and corresponding material going to them from piata so if you miss that session but you Renault boxer with your Python do checkout that stuff what's the thinking of doing one kind of a bit later in the term focused on numpy for scientific computing that is kind of like vectorising your code and also pytorch which this year of a kind of pitching as the default so is she might make for doing people Watford put some stuff to come a few other things that I just wanted to mention first a bunch of people have asked about the role of The Notebook in my view for this year what the notebooks do is complement the main lecture so what were trying to do in here with you all is give you a guided tour of the can't some stuff real work will start when you open one of us one of us notebook narrative whenever you don't understand something are you haven't open question or something else you want to pursue you use the code in bed in that notebook to answer that question for yourself turns on learning that I think it really push you and you they are also useful if you open up the homework notebook and feel kind of it see about how things work the actual notebook cement what's the play that kind of informal role play if we have questions every line of chords I mean complicated stuff and you can spend a whole lifetime meditating on anyone point of it so my picture to you would be when you have question a good way for you to begin to answer them for primary thing that I want it's not so much about evaluating that you do a particular kind of Reading or anything but rather just empowering this is meant to give you a head start on April also they said on on the first day to try the converter what we understand to be best price projects running experiments dealing with date struggling your setup you can post them to you outside we might be able to stuff that you could do on your own that might help with debugging and I think one powerful way that you could check the health of your class environment it's actually use the tests that are embedded in the github repository is a subdirectory called Test from all these files test underscore in a line and stuff we've got pretty good coverage across all the core code and if you use pytest' which is installed if you use anaconda and you at 10 because it gives you a kind of health dashboard I'm one of these files the test the tests in this directory should pass sing like you know how you haven't installed this library or something and that would be really helpful for people trying to debunk with what's I'm just kind of putting this pytest' is a very easy way to read a budget as you basically treated as a test told you so you can get really good sing the mighty of utility the you is that I have in test and p model grade checking infrastructure so if you write your own mod that to check itself by way of kind of summer random announcements for the homework one I have a few things that I want to clarify let's start with easier stuff so I hope it's emerging by now and it's certainly going to emerge today pointwise mutual information powerful insight related to all this stuff not only waiting for the offer dimensionality reduction result is a very natural baseline doing a project in the space play sister Lane results table had a road it was just what happened fire PMI because you can better ring that you're actually advocating for is in some sense related to or complements or is an opposition to the PMI in reason for having that is the first homework is just to push you this entry fill in the first row of that result exploring Word band things were going to talk about our say today explain to you why you might want to check a bunch of these different k value you know when it's just a toe in the water in the glove model which we gonna talk about today to possibly developed and Powerful having done those first three questions at all about the rest of this material ideas for your rational Isabelle what is like distance to the words and Windows like the scaling that's what I thought you were going to say whereby word mate interpreter what's happening because if I look across the role at the different column values I can see like this is the strength of association in some sense with the word amazing or the word Tara radiant vermin with talking about huge high-dimensional spaces so it's not analytical but then once you start to do things like love or Ella say which will talk about today the columns become match actually at the first point feeling like you did turn house lights on scaling icons what is that separate separate out and I would say scaling is you model question about how proximity to your vocal count them all the same whether you feel like being further away is less of a coconut ultimatrix you have decided national space in for there but I kind of want to quote this famous in mathematics you don't understand I feel like a lot of this I've already picked you that via said that neighbours function is away Frost different matrices used up will give you into visualisation you might just have to clarification the first one is easy on I threw into vsm data this adjective adverb m from giga word as adverb adjective dependency Paris which I think is a really interesting notion of context very different from just raw like being in their window I didn't mean for you to have to make sure that your Bake Off entry work for that mate what is a completely different vocabulary and so just a clarification thinking about is the two IMDb ones and the to digger world the heroic thing it will take to get the experiment go to work with that I want to do that scratch how did the note just Clarifying really explicit cough not external vent you shouldn't just download the preacher in glove or the preaching birth or Elmo where other representations that you've heard about and enter them into the Bake off what I'm trying to do the Spirit of this is to say the count matrices that I gave you so we all begin from Michael level playing field same spot and then do cool things to those mate complicated because I want to encourage you to do retrofitting so I can't say something is clean outside information because I think retrofitting to word that isn't worthwhile thing to do when I'm not talk about how you might do that in a little bit text thing of saying no external debt I mean Part of Me wants to just leave you completely unfair you want behind like figuring out with the in the real world if you dented and bake how much would a this is an attempt to I don't know download Burton elm all models in play we're doing the big off oh ok but then again I never win these bake off so what do I I have thought about this I don't know what the answer is yeah psm3 actually download the free love Mum ok use excluded that you would use the glove ones but that you could use the vectors from liking older ones that you had developed you could retrofit down that's the spirit of this but in doing that you'd be bringing in wordnet structure and that's what I fall apart on the side of not introducing outside in you're bad I'm having his like right thing to do to download Burke and do some cool reweighting and then learn a function that will be really really bad scientific and Elmo remind me to see that you know massage in various ways maybe that's the writing sometimes like I don't want you to feel constrained artificial because what's the sense in that on the other hand it would be kind of sad turn off and everybody got the same play Thor the inside set of Rules now we'll see what happens for a future Baker play this game because let's just say not having to manipulate I didn't know you could do once you've implemented the sweetest thing here you could run that on another lonely duckling in the vsm director play the snow park you can just read nyt ad mad mate it's just there for fun I studied scalar adjectives the Vue stillicide the wrong vocabulary centre the bay errors if you try to make sure your code works with that mate worried about you all like bad stop this notebook so this is a small change that I push so strange how the mind works I guess I woke up this morning that I had made this or Miss if I had I don't know why the crew 2 made the pointed it set similarity evaluation play maid it's just exposing dissed phone it wasn't exposed and that meant that when you called word similarity evaluation down here it was going to use cosine because cosine is the default for that funk quietly thing interesting source of innovation for this Bake-Off would be that people actually thought a lot about that is cosigner Euclidean or jacquard really need to have in that position for this code to work function that will take two vectors and produce a real value think about it at that level stuff that you can do that with kind of go beyond the methods I'm introducing but some of you have the background that could make that very turn the function of the self but I was sad that I had not exposed song if you don't use my updated version but I kind of income instead I wanted to wave you getting you familiar with this this is that the repository I hope you are working productively in this repository point out that kind of on the back and model inside there are three groups of model fixed once that's for numpy simple versions of the models like autoencoder and classifier pause everything so if you really want to understand when do the hide when the systems learn things from data going Places you just want to get some interesting work whether the torch version or the tensorflow plan to just switch to torch because I think the code is really nice and transport modifications in I'm going to ask you to do some of that search for the tensorflow is fast cancel if you need to get a big job done or you just accustomed to tensorflow then there's your there for you as well and just conspicuously missing as I can tell it's very difficult to do models with kind of arbitrary graphical structure intensive push me off thought I would do a shout I just posted some nice improvements to the pytorch code and there thanks to thank the people were helping me get Craig found credits that's posted on piazza pronouncement in preparatory material any questions ask me anything before we dive in play some updates to the slideshow so you might want to download the version downloaded from the web again please just additions but there were a couple of corrections beyond the video I'm not sure if you're taking notes and you started taking notes on the first PDA otherwise you could just download a fresh copy play improvements is the slide 26 and that's kind of where I want to start last time we talked about matrix designs electric comparison and we started in on basic reweighting comparison kind of three big ideas big comparison method so first was Euclidean call sign call those kind of like that the classical geometric figure studies matching coefficient sorry all these methods are based on matching coefficient lecture carnon Dyson overlap I introduce the family ballistic vector compare good choices if you are dealing with things that you would call probability Canada part of that section did some relationships and generalizations which you can use the code to check if you like by way of trying to make sense of this other startup that I wanted to do after class we walked back to the but I could tell that something was bugging him talking and I keep trying to figure out what single I managed to extract from him that was clearly bud I had called a lot of these things distance where I stated cosine proper distance kind of knew this I had just not made much of it but actually like this as a way of additionally like making sense of the options here kind of summarises the argue is a Distance metric a vector comparison method d has to be 02 satisfied crucially this thing called the Triangle distance between x and z what's better equal 2xy 2yz the triangle inequality from kind of see here like if this is me at the bar these two things the some of them have to be large intuitive just inside to find it because it fails that triangle in it's very easy to find Carna examples and here's just one random that would show that as I defy corrector use the definition here no myself why this isn't for example the version that's in numpy Jesus the one that I am which seems to be prevented this is the correct metric version I think in this term help you make decisions because the only things that are distance matrix of the stuff I introduce our Euclidean is it defined in this new way art distance metrics are all those matching methods vergence because it's not even symmetric but also symmetric Ko is not a proper distance metric and of course kale with stew reference versus the target chaos Cards this elegant as a classification and you want to work only with proper Med probabilistic space nice proper I'm more classically geometric note Ian or the corrected cosine sing about that I think will emerge especially today is actress basic scanner properly normalized like for example if you do the L2 norm doesn't matter at all that's a point that I made before that acts that you can check with the code play do cosine distance exact same result if I do the L2 norm Christian as the comparison generalisations the numbers it's all the same where about is no any kind of Clarifying from this whole mess of things that I offered and it went by way of just helping you with keywords you might encounter and the literature I think we can distil it find me mobile that was kind of a recap with a little bit of bonus card talking about re waiting play Dave the goals here which is kind of amplify the important and de-emphasize the mundane in the cork to normal and probability distributions is waiting to do that and then I kind of past you and I said observed over expected this is a really important idea because you see this throughout all of these methods that I'm going to introduce today message matter play doing this metric years measuring plating or expectation for the count based on the row in the car wearing that to the axe petition smaller than the actual account we should emplify Matthew and so what I tried to do is just I added this line this is a kind of intuitive exam this is that the word tip is incredibly frequent it and cars with lots of other is pretty frequent turn down the column this word tabs here it's idiomatically related how does an itself it does occur outside of that Indian but relatively this is a kind of collocational idiomatic Express add should have a really high you can't when you go through the expected values here this is the full calculation and then you get these expected that you were hoping for Innocence there are expected turn the probability of the road give the column tab what is 12 becoming more than we would expect bypass timing enjoy the fact of the actual account is all observed over expected is doing doing is dividing the actual account the observed hope to see next step B&Q Reading I think that's kind of the intuition keep Android because they're both kinda frequent and it's no surprise that they occur having the expected value be just a little bit bigger than the actual value that's kind of good way more frequently with then we would expect roll in the car it's not higher than 12 well maybe realistically it is my exam change the numbers I guess you go to me in the sense that by 30 1020 / this is a basically what we expected everything was Independence roee is a frequency independence apparently the evaluation of how often something happened play for the first part if you think about these and probabilistic terms then this is a kind of the probability the joint probability that you would expect even at the role in the colon I wasn't sure depending on the actual frequency that another class A documents 20e for them separately but then still take it or leave that you get in the class 1 and Class 2 and compare them without uni scary I just passed a little bit just because I do want to show you some stuff about how this are we maybe not ID genuine this point in part because I told you that pm I was the hero of the story play is just logspace expect when you normally see this calculation people have done what I've done here we're joint probability calculations in terms of those probably comes out the same as if you do it with the Rock count what kind of basis for the TMI reweight new fundamental thing is OC but in logspace and I highlighted this orange values because you can see that this is prone to exaggerating very small lonely in this row in this column really big in the final key for a while one is probably not so important precise exciting Platts here just two can I give you a sense for PMI values and how they scale check that out important extension of PMI positive PMI exactly the default for avsm because in certain respects articulate the argument for why you might choose this positive is actually undefined when the count is 0 take a lager is what to do in the Forest give above here kind of implicitly write with log 0 equals 0 0 paper about message in wanting a point out it's just that this is kind of income I large with an expected count get a really large other than expected counts get a really small PMI let's perfectly into it this log 0 = 0 thing and can't stop get placed in the middle of that right what evidence for being in the mid don't know something a miss response that kind of cleaned the soap is just to say that that would be below zero I'm at remove all information about elements that smaller than 0 because I can't disagree you're losing a lot of London weather tomorrow it's a great question I guess question which behaves can give you some guidance around this because obviously you're doing something pretty serious to the underlined play some analytic guidance about whether this is the right parliamentary app it was just exactly the same as this is exactly a couple of more and then will step back another famous reweighting ski slightly different notions of Rohan Khan from information retrieval time in terms of two things for first term frequency get in r reading everything in the normalise column wise column wise term freaking is columns word first document frequency is essentially counting determined weather what the calculation is essentially doing is amplifying the values for things that occurred very future tf-idf is the product is that your going to get really high tf-idf high probability for you overrepresented along very few like saying that that turn associate presented in show in appearing in Italy example of the calculations just to make it really concrete you can do that I D fly values have some plants that kind of show you how these values tend to scale so for example setting aside the 0 case which is always a problem model larger as I accrue more x-axis the idf values go down and like the epitome of a high idf value is to return just one doc associated with that one is high frequency in that door idsr CCF you can nothing would stop you it's perfectly define play problematic to use these very dense matrices tf-idf there really kind art of Spa if you have a word that appears in every doc call Chris with every other word like a stopword than this tf-idf values I was kind of hoping you'll discover that for yourselves but I've given that for very sparse word by document for exam time in again to be a really Powerful way too fine forgiving query that I really when you're implementing and I like that one just because if you start this long enough you can see that this is a kind of PMI intuition as well tf-idf variants anyone that could just throw out there is I could read a pairwise distance osteria wedding scheme where like all these values in here are the cosine distances between back for a sec last time I've been a bit of a framework for thinking about free waiting skins are doing play ask yourself as you're making these choice it was just that you should look at the distribution of cell values that result from doing the room what that might mean for your map that out for the ones that we've looked at so up here rock Oz actually like you can see that there are shaped like this actually much worse than this part appears because I did the log scale for the y-axis otherwise it look like everything was just at 1 really strange zipline or log-log distributes to deal with a lot of methods look at what happens when we take that that incoming distribution and change it in various way the L2 Norm has more of a u shape these are kind of similar of I confess that I don't have why has this kind of over expected values have a similar distribution to the Rock Oz you not so good because even though we're amplifying some stuff friendly picture because it looks quite normally distributed gpmi just chatting off the westhouse and amplifying all the Zeros but it's still not a scary looking as for example the Rock counts and then tf-idf looks a lot like the questions is just behind just staring at these distributions you can also I know it's hard to read but you can look along the x-axis at the actual cell value 02 housing is World war m Norma courses 021 021 over expected that kind of constrained in a space like so even though it looks like a scary distribution the x-axis is much tighter am I in pmis like you're -10 to about 20 is normal Isis probabilities L2 Norm least constrained and then the tf-idf values have a similar paul valery play a size that is just that if you think about taking distance measurements in the space what sensitive some methods are to the magnitude of these a picture of how much about distance is going to matter in the description probabilities I just mean that I row normalized using that's entire for all 2 g of all the cells put a picture made to you with that you might think about how the co-occurrence counts to the reweighted for example if your reweighting scheme national shift of the underline count it's probably not so meaning for what we really want presumably if to see something really use cell values and how they correlate receipt 5-ft do that this Potter a little bit harder to understand but like appear L2 Norman so long the x-axis is the co-occurrence cancer is the Ross Eldar skill to make it easier to see WhatsApp new weighted value it's a very occasion hair which I've given up at the top how do I can make sense of the space Force a rather at least I know it's different from the underlying counts I did something meaning meeting with the L2 expected Christian is kind of strange actually don't know what these artifacts are we value ipmi that's really nice right there's essentially no correlation between underline count David Bowie BPM I actually has a pretty High Court by this measure the release different from the other you don't understand completely why they have the particular shapes that they do that something is happy 1 is it the smaller correlation say that I can go so far as to say bye let me stay know I did it really depends on how much you think the underlying Council report whether or not you think frequency is information that you want to preserve generalisations just by way of wrapping up this unit year so have all of this as I've said before is that we want a way to sell them valuable expect given its role and weighting schemes and up favouring rare events that may not be trustworthy if you have the kind of Watch Bluetooth counts can be important right so 1 and 10 Nintendo very different if you take a probability distribution they will look science variable amplify the values of counts that are tiny relative to the Rose in the car and columns and that can be a the question from the back they're tf-idf severely punishes words that appear in many dock hardly for a dance if you code snippets here again all of this is in The Notebook elephant for the home be nice to consolidated here and show for example you can do observed over expected dermalize listen without positive show you that we're making some progress at the end of class last time I showed you the word bad IMDb five mate highly skilled terrible collocation on is a period and then taste in and I again I do PMI bad or good awful terrible horror progress semantic space horrible seem like they should be in your bad even though they have different frequency worry that good is problem that you cannot want a quality result because you short section in herons spring in subword information idea and I just wanted to make you aware of it and show you some code that will allow you to do my mind at least races to a seminal paper by Hendricks if you did some subway modelling UK some sparsity find different and more abstract papilocare summer modelling Whirlpool morphological variants closer together right you might find yourself seeing abstract connections between all the adjectives that end in able play that you wouldn't if you facilitate the modelling of adult vocabulary items because if you don't have a representation for a word you can retrieve can also reduce the importance of any particular tokenization LPS apriori thing that you do before you start solving your huge less than sketching technique using the data that we have method quickly in their questions your free day club RDS am like the ones we've been working vector for a character Level and are the vectors of words containing gone down into the word are treated although represent each word as the sum of its Character level engrams that's the sensing which you could gather strength from all the parts this is a nice touch if you have a representation for the actual word bring that in is handsome subword mod all atom information from different parts of your corpus that would have been completely neglect an example of how you might decompose the word superb and the only thing that's worse putting out there is I do think it's valuable to have this notion of start and end the code snippet I just wrote A Few utility functions that will allow you to create an and Graham space for any and that you choose then this look like character-level reppir it's just a small function that I wrote the present present one way of mapping a word the word model show at the bottom here that even though superbly as a word is not in the vector space play representation interesting if you look probably relates to other words you see some stuff it's good might were you like now it's very close to super like adverbs that end in ly maybe over emphasizing the subway general I think I think that to the Bake Off last year when was often Frank same the same that's what you have to create this IMDb five different dimension hourly rate All Hours have dimension 5K by 5K but this one because they're more and Graham I must 10 kg find decision so that we can use the original account this suburb we keep the notion of co-occurrence approach in your documents beforehand will be really different ways of sending would be like a pose cos they're you would be saying that I'm going to get rid of a lot of this morphological staff at the end where is here you might be so in the way in which superbly is related to all this other end you not here I'm not going to spend too much time on this but I think this can be really valuable for doing exploring visualisation our goal is to visualise and very high dimensional spaces in two or three dimensions so that week to accept upfront this is going to involve a bunch of compromise BAC high-dimensional space into 2D that preserves all that structure and lessons that your original matrix had very little structure the beginning Samsung compromises in but out my pitch to you will be there you can still be great because it can give you a feel for a what's in your vsm especially nice to pair this with some kind of qualitative investigations using the neighbour's funk like with a holistic picture it's approx trampoline with neighbours weather York the turkeys for doing this and in fact in recent years scikit-learn has added a bunch of or user guide so I would think if you want to go beyond when I'm going to show you what they can do when I talk a lot about the trade-offs for very what I've included in BSM is a little wrapper around cyclists implementation sure whether I'm saying that right but I've been saying it for years she distributed stochastic neighbour embedding what is algorithm is trying to do is go from a very high dimensional space Aldi reduction in a way that you can lay things out in a few demand having a lot of local structural the snip that a Giga 5 that matrix after I did sorry Dig It 20 after I did positive pointwise mutual information on say that this looks pretty good I think this is quite beaut it looks like a giant blob is a lot of local local structure that I think to sneak and capture pretty well and that is telling me that there's kind dense neighborhoods that are in actually so Hero 2 Exam um1 smart ariba lots of stuff about Qatar this is lots of stuff about war politics and self-worth but it's really semantically come sending this is IMDb 12 pretty good local structure in here positive lots of positive words good ones play this is nice because not only is there pretty good preservation of sentiment in the space can you if you adjective when people talk about positive and negative things they talk about someone different aspects of these movie they complain a lot about the dialogue but they thought they say what is nice things about turn on light little bit of code for using the rapid that I wrote nice add-on that I want to mention is that which is call TVs vector of colours whatever you want as long as it align with your play the words in those colors example here I just downloaded a sentiment lexicon all the positive words in blue you kind of nice to see for something that you expect to align with your cement the semantics of your space how well is it actually open RC that's a blue plaster install the new visualisation like this forever can you interpret white where the clusters are in relation to one another bring the starts to break down certainly you can't trust anything about position on the plane in an absolute sense because as you rerun to Snee you'll see rotations of approximately the same I'm wrong but I think it is not meaning for that like wherever blob this is what's the weather blog that kind of influences getting dispersed pretty fast what time does phase that we want to do here is dimensionality reduction I'm going to present you a few into it and methods for doing play give you a sensible why you might pick one over how to say class matrix factorization method called latent semantic analysis truncated svd for singular value decomposition undermine all this and most widely used traduction say that it is a standard baseline and often very tough open maps dropping off a table of results the second role in I'm just TM walk through the algorithm with you because in my experience this is kind of the combination of a class in when you're algebra that the relevant concepts we don't do that I can give you a sense from why this works and why you might want to look like inspiring interns intruder abdc play a custom to doing something like fitting of any aggression to those Orange Wine station that linear regressions going to find the source of largest variation Among Us um3 can you can do is think of call as saying that be are you is on this light right here it's fitted values on this one right here so you lose one dimension of variation for the sake of this millennium what happens if you do that if you do that mental projection of pulling be down closer together racing which have abstracted away from one dimension of area abstract connection between this is even easier to think about if you go 3D about the Stanford campus price of variation is kind of XY Samsung call Builder if you were standing at the base of the hoover Tower infill is at the top because the hoover tower is pretty tall play to abstract away from the Sparticle dimension I just said I'm just going to look at the between and it'll be pulled down and have earache Wychwood doing dimensionality reduction for taking something in 3D cancel that we find a connection that was kind of missing from the is singular value decomposition a is that for any Matrix and Diane decomposition into 3 m do you think I was like the row rotation or the Romans SuperValu what's the diagonal skip this 3 m equals the level of the full becomes edition haven't done anything like that just showing you a decomposition of the original mate interesting is when we start to think about dimensional version approximate the phone M sub par motivate that space of magic read my example is still pretty true early as an adjective is a west coast wicked is kind of Russia's counterpart on the what's the news Spennymoor the linguist think it's a kind of magic where is wicked above puzzle style Express recurring any luck are there will happen is that you'll have neighbours in record for both tender over her with awesome contest like across the world across the country anyway not into a curl with Leila and Sarah oppose excuse the methods that I showed you so far and I calculate distance in this film Matrix really far apart really far apart is again thing back to my countess metaphor they're not abstractly anywhere near each other cuz they never co-occur what is a kind of second-order notion of Coca-Cola other things that may vary notion we have to do so singular value decomposition singular values index this is the truncated just the top 2 dementia ensures that the singular values are organised by their size set corresponding this calendar organised by colour information on the approximate reconstruction using Just The Two columns here new breakfast can you vector space Marlene wicked or really as found Oceana I didn't want to find out the family of these methods that you can think of I'm essentially the same until play out I say because it's like the class comparisons red and pitching this is a way of understanding what happened to the space of the high-level here the Rock counts ylsy directly I get kind of this funny disc I think that's because LSA as a fundamental the least squares method is not so well matched to the Zippy and distribution of counts coming ipmi which I showed you has this kind of nice and normal values for LSA also have a similar me differently scale animal track about this so when you read about translated svd or LSA the question comes up of how you would pick the dimension h l like I picked to hear working with matrices that have 5010 text the values that you want to Pierce scenario that you read about it when you plot the singular church of high values and they really rapid drop off star that you take as my dimension out it because I have such a clear fall off in information about this Never Happens my distribution of single about his 10 to look like this this is actually from one of the matrices do you like I have no idea which value of k tape because quick thing in a smoothie drop off why as you can see from the homework this emerges is a kind of heuristic empirical issue times of different values of k find gives you the game you're looking for on the task that you see one of these dream scenarios do posted auntie all the fame for I'll be mostly this wall of confusion play Hero bunch of other methods in a lot of them are implemented in scikit learn in its decomposition and manner comments before I move on to another snippets I think this is really easy they're just there for autoencoders deep learning model flexible deep learning architectures for learning reduced dimensional representation name of the game here let me give you the internet examples for example the 5000 dimensional Rose count where is the rock That Really high-dimensional thing and pass it through this very narrow layer in orange dimension 104 the autoencoder is to do it best to reconstruct the in it's no piping and try to reproduce it of course you expect given a complex enough incoming matrix to have some information loss information last with LSA the hope of the autoencoder is that it will learn information that's not so the sources of variation that really matter Samsung which will get a powerful intermediate represent another encoder we traded against this reconstruction of jak2 are actually interested in is say that it can work with 5000 dimensional vector coming is there outside the audio encoder what's the dimension my first run LSA hardest model external dimensionality reduction in Feed that through your network and try to the pain of here I thought it would be nice to just show you everything you need if you wanted to implement this Honor encoder from scratch Aswad go up in the notation is all here in the list shows you had a calculate the gradient so I use exactly the notation hi implementation that's included with the course Repo we go down and see what very straightforward model information and hope that it works out for the would be what we use what time the homework to protect workers autoencoders the fit method Returns that matrix of in representations of any kind of acts like LS the cast of E news well there's lots of possibilities what you do but the the Sharpie answer is if you feed in Rock Oz the model will try to reproduce The Rock reading the LSA representation it would try to fixtures will be different than not standard order it would if you had the Kingdom input and output just copy you're forcing it to pass it through this narrow pipe it has to loosen presented buried code for doing this the interfaces or maybe a little bit non-standard and I tried a few different things here in particular I guess you're I tried to like normalized rock Oz coming in cuz I think that's a very 4D planning architecture to have Rock it's pretty well I think you need to run it for longer than I did the proof of good autoencoder looks much better autoencoder fancy Irene PMI playlist dimension 101st garden to the other about that play Timon and one more model just quickly in Worcester go back my favourite emojis dimensionality reduction techniques for a few about it was developed to extend Pennington and Richard socher and Chris Manning paper a right at the outset as a kind of magic paper highly recommend that you read it not only for the content but also just to experience a really well written well motivated paper in our space not all of them are what is a kind of example really nicely articulate the high-level goals issue in the context that you're in right now which is the Likely have method TMI we have word to that about their strengths and weaknesses really think about what we are trying to do when we bill Ward actor over like section 2 the build up this model very carefully and then of course the hydrate experiment play Release code and a release freetrain word benefited from in lots of ways package of what you'll be looking for in a car please speak in the objectives for glovers to learn vectors for words dot product is proportional to the probability of their colour already sent to you like p.m. practical details were using the implementation in the Midlands package which I wrote with knitting wool because we have a variant of glove it's glove with a warm start and wheat should also be fast because we found a way of vectorise glove that form Morris jobs in for really big things you should use the glove team seeing women employment depressive engineer best one slide for you but I would like to just plant the seed at the top here this is the glove objective you can see that ion k pictures that will learn dot product play that you've seen before because if you think back too the similarity product over the normalisation constant there so this is kind of cosine similarity highest earner is that equal to the log of the compactor with a b a define this product here of the probability of occurrence and that is the log of the Colour no problem what date does subtract only the row long probably is there a swimming at this stage what they call the exchange symmetry which is that in the Matrix the columns of the play soon they're dealing with a word by word pie squared now that the rows in the columns might be different in fact they construct matrices with the rows in the cones are different and you might do that as well benefactor in the column probability turn down here so you have the log of the Colour currants minus the log of the product of the row in the colon probability thing that you've seen before that is p.m. by the equivalence of this lovely argument that sounds like it's in a different place for npm the PMI place now dpmi remember that work love is doing is learning reduced dimensional represent reweighting in dimensionality reduction all at once and you can see this objective on the same inside it do other things that are really meaningful so I don't want to minimise them because this is kind of the ideal object objective is a weighted version of why they chose the wedding scheme that they did just in the interest of this having been a lot of content I propose that we wrap up here glove paper slide and then we'll pick up there Pinterest
