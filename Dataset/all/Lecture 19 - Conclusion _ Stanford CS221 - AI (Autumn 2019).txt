the smaller group of people today so yeah so just a quick announcement and project reports or do next Friday so just make sure that you're Returned and you're putting with awesome so shut up for a little bit of it by the posters that I saw was really amazing and I really enjoyed like the groups I talked to in good job and all the projects it was are you going to have a best poster award thing to and we're going to announce that on to yourselves later so alright Corso what's conclude the lecture saucy SE22 the plan for today we're going to do a quick summary of what theatre general summary of the class like all the things that you have and then I wanna talk a little bit about for the next courses that you might want to take after taking to 21 if you were in 229 and in the morning they they went over by talk next courses from the perspective of 229 or the one would want to take a kind of doing a similar same here but from the view of 221 what would be the next course is that and then after that I want to talk a little bit about the history of AI within the first lecture so would be a little bit of a video that but then I want to talk a little bit also bad some the next Direction instead might be interesting to think about it so the research that is done differently in various topics of subtopics of AI and what are some of the problems that you're struggling with so it would be fine to think about that and if you're interested in any of that you can go to research in that area or take classes and was pretty cool so that's kind it's going to be shorter than usual so probably an hour alright so so footsack about the summary of the class so we started the class talking about this paradigm of modelling inference and learning right so so we started thinking about how to adjust the real-world problem you're going to pick up a real-world problem and you're going to do modelling or modelling would be an extraction of that real-world problem and in general we are interested in reasoning about that real-world problem by finding the shortest path or solving some sort of optimisation about that problem and we called that model of the road and then we do in France video of the warning the learning part of our experience was that will our models are not going to be perfect right you're not going to be perfectly everything in the instead we might have a partial model an addition to that you might have some data around the role and around the things that are happening in the world so we would like to use that data to learn about the model and cannot complete our model so this was kind of the common paradigm through the class and this the topics that recovered you started with machine learning and machine learning as a tool that allows us to better wearing these models parmiters of these models and then we talked about the various levels of intelligence in the course right so we started with reflux base models then drink resellable entitled to bed talk about state-based models very well base models and finally the Highbury for you just remind you of something machine learning kind of the common saying that you started looking at was this idea of Ross minimization so so we have some data we have some training data input and output X and Y and then my son so lost we look at different types of whilst Mansions and properties of these last one and then the idea was we would want to minimise this training lasts for the hope of generalizing to a new scenario right for the whole pub if I get some sort of new input I would be able to give the best at with possible with respect to that so so I would in general I would like to minimise my test but one way to go about that is to minimise is training what based on something and any approaching forward for that was using techniques like a stochastic gradient descent so this will be the most common thing one would want to do so we had this last function how do I go back optimising it I take a gradient and moving in negative direction of the gradient so-so stochastic gradient descent with commonly 2 things like writing out the last minimising and doing something somewhere to stochastic gradient descent this was kind of common across a lot of different machine learning algorithms that use throughout the course and reply data wide range of Mars we would like a Friday's to ask herself model said he had and reflect space models are a stupid models with cannabis theme so an in the first set of lecturers my head we started talking about reflex base models simplest form of which was linear models classification linear models linear classifiers and you just wanted to learn the parameters of that and Anna more complex version of that are things like neural networks deep neural networks or even like nearest neighbours would be an example space mod and what was inference for inference was pretty easy when it came to this thanks inference was just a feed-forward one of your model and I will give you the so when doing that my hard work but it would come to it and in terms of learning we would lead to the Catholic readings of things like alternating as a way of learning this my source of H reflex base then increasing the level of complex tomatoes and and the cleaner that I want to go to remember from the CPS models is the idea what is a state of state is a summary of all past actions that is sufficient to choose the future actions off and then you say the good amount of time thinking about how to define it why can't I could stay and how do how to do this this morning when it comes to state-based models and and look at things like search problems we have the Terminus systems that things like and be peace when you're playing against nature with a little bit of and then you will chat things like games where you're playing against some other intelligent agents there some other intelligent agent coming in find and any terms of interest will tell a couple of really cool we talk about uniform cost a store dynamic programming valuation minimax have recovered a said number of different different ways of intelligently looking at these models and doing in and then when it came to learning with that structured perceptron q-learning TV learning reinforcement learning in general that goes for someone to learning algorithm send me a pie when it came to stay so so that was deeply tomorrow's send and move the level of complex again intelligence a little bit higher and we would like things like variable any of the ordering of these States doesn't matter it's just a relationship it find things like BattleCraft so if you remember the mat colouring example with define de facto giraffe around it and your dear was there is a scratch that graph structure data captures the conditional independence between different variables different variables in this what is the different provinces and then you would want to call them differently and the relationship between them is going to be represented by a fact the two types of models with discussed in the sitting work and stress satisfaction problems and Vision network vision networks in the case where we have produced a relationship and then you talk about difference specifically backtracking forward-backward being search give sampling as various ways of doing in France on Deezer animal came to learning with things like maximum likelihood and to try to do and then finally the last few Waitrose we've been talking you at logic so pushing the above complex he just a little bit higher and thinking about formulas like actual like logical formulas that represent intelligence about your system so so the key ideal Logic is freaking had these powerful formula to represent powerful like meaningful things about your can you talk about things like for positional yjk first anniversary logic and we talked about model checking which is commonly used in satisfiability modus ponens resolution as various types of inference algorithms that could be used really have logic when it comes to write again I would say this is kind of like an open question still like how how do you combine ideas from learning and ideas from logic and get the Best of Both Worlds there are ways of combining them but how do you ensure that you are getting Best of Both Worlds like from data-driven wait up we can get things and model-based so what did cs221 crossword gives us a set of tools look at the road and and think about difficult problems in the world and pick the right model speaking pick the right like way of formulating a problem and inference algorithm to go back song so I was saying it's pretty much like with covered or water material so so recovered bread set a set of topics and the idea of it is to know that you have all these tools and you can pull out his tools and you can go with in any of them but the goal of cs221 was to just give a broad View of what is artificial intelligence and what are some of these tools that that but if you're interested in going a little bit deeper in any of these topics that you've discussed in the class good number of passes that just briefly mentioned some of them and over I will caramelizar classes the next classes that you can take it to into two main categories you can take foundational classes that you go deeper in someone to Foundation of things you're talking rod or you can take application classes where you go deeper in like the specific applications like natural language processing vision robotics the specific application instead some of the foundation and next course that you might be interested in taking an all of these are also posted on their website so I don't stand for flash Scores so that's animations but if you're interested in more on the application side of things there's a good number of courses are on natural language processing I'm going to go again I will be the price of these courses and then number forces around vision good number forces around robotics there's also this other Corsa on general game playing if you're in I'm just briefly mention like one slide on some of these courses that I think would be a good courses to take so one of cs228 so it is a problem for graphical models if you remember the variable variable base models part of part of the lecture this would be kind of the next course that goes deeper and that so so we talked about Albert sounds like forward-backward very patient but if you take you to NE8 you'll be talking buy more channels for sounds like for you for probation for your show and friends Markov chain Monte Carlo in and another thing that 228 is going to cover is in very well base models like the way you treated things was the money was given a structure was given to us right this is an 8-mm and given that is an 8-mm I'm going to do this extra things en228 you would actually be thinking about learning the structure learning a write structure to put in and and how do you think about these different variables and the relay if you want to go different that another interesting Corsa taken so he might have already taken it is the machine learning course so in this class that we were treated machine morning was just as a to write like we had a few matches on it and we just learnt about machine learning Justin for us to to do some of the things you want to do in this AI course definitely brighter than what we discussed in the class and it's always that it is broader and more generally discussed in the classes in this class we talked about discrete actions and discreet and discrete time discrete action and type systems 229 is going to cover my brother said I said I said off models are you actually thinking about continue with you a little bit earlier models 221 we'll talk about kernel methods decision tree boosting bagging feature selection like all these sorts of different types of algorithms and models that are going to go beyond what you discussed in this I came you to talk about more broader set of clustering algorithms like mixture a really useful with classic if you if you want to just learn one unpractical if you're more interesting in this theoretical process theoretical side of machine learning there is this other cortical 229 so this is statistical learning theory and this is going to actually think about the mathematical principles behind so so it doesn't necessarily cover the particular out with them but it's going to cover like properties mathematical properties around at all because I'm saying things like uniform convergence so so you have a predictor and you want to make sure that predictor with high probability is going to have some banded how are you going to be on the area of that how you going down the test with respect to the training area and some properties up of York or how we do for my life things like ring of your learning algorithm stop thinking about complex anything you buy putting balance convergence regret these are going to be the topics that will be discussed in the statistical learning theory if you're more turn out thinking more on the application side of things so a couple of good applications of AI after discourse or things are on Vision and opium robotics I was kind of three main applications that you might want to consider going for an if you're interested in if you're interested in vision a good number of classes around vision of interesting tasks around Britain sold and more and more research things around like object recognition and detection and segmentation but also things like activity right frames are different frames of a video of a soccer game how would you predict where the ball goes out how do you predict when a person goes in the next few friends difficult problem activity recognition from just frames of image so if you're interested is all these problems from the Vision perspective I would recommend taking to 31 robotics review another interesting application to look at so in robotics in general you're interested in problems around manipulation and navigation and grass so the mean application said you might think about her things are on self-driving cars medical robotics assistive robot an interesting thing I'd robotic Springs is that there is a physical system sitting there so you're putting your elbows and the things you have developed in this class and some stuff behind it and it's physical assistant is it called robot and you need to deal with things like continuata you need to deal with things like uncertainty and then you need to deal with physical models that could come from kinematics and control so there a lot of interesting robotics classes if you're so exciting into a robotics is offered next corridor summer cattiva stitching but there is also new robotics series course that just came out so this is the robot on my one and two cancel advertisement for my next order with my cup of an engine it was already offered and the other but I mean one is to just cover the different layers of the robotic Stack and at the end of the day they actually have this product is really cool project where you have you have a robot platform and you have a wider on top of it and you want this robot to just move around in a fake city is so if you're interested in I think the project the project presentation is not already done so so if you're interested to show up to do around and see how how these robots are moving around basically had to speak City for this robot just navigator on in this big city and does autonomous driving a picture of a bicycle in the back for the robot detected and it's actually like moving off the voice recorder nation and other agents next time you won in Robert anime to winter what we want to do if you want him anything later on top of the robot so you're looking at mobile manipulation will be actually have an arm and you have this arm pick up objects and blocks and put them on top of each other and I'm doing a reaction as it causes too big chunks of the plot of is focused on interaction with the physical world and interaction with other agents that are interesting multi-agent I gave your questions that could come up when you have multiple robots trying to interact with each other ideas from games with come up there like naturally so so that was robotics and then another interesting application is natural language processing natural language processing in particularly very interesting because if you think about it the role this continue but the words that you're using order Sky and is discrete words have continuous meaning so there is a mismatch between the fact that we have discrete words and continuous world and and and you need to use these words to describe the discontinuous very interesting questions in and around by compositionality and grounding and if you're interested in this types of an interesting Castello more soft vs play Salt and more research around NLP so if you're interested in any of them I would recommend taking classes 24 so some of these task around like machine translation and text summarisation dialux I would like to text conversation and I like so you had a couple of a homework different Dad I do recommend taking a note the foundation and more application you courses that I would come and take I briefly mentioned to water courses to that are that are not necessarily directly in a neighbouring field that would be interesting to look what is looking at s m tyres in general with that how human mind works and it's one of those feels that that can do together with a I started to get face but they still tend to inform each other and there's a group of scientists who are looking at computational cognitive science and he was ideas like version modelling and probabilistic programs when the cognitive Sciences course site to a forwarded cross listed as the A428 I think know a good mentor Justice and I think this would be a great course to take if you're interested in a couple of science side of things and you would have ideas and topics from working in this area that's one what do you think about science as one of the software here neuroscience and Yahoo is is the hardware of the problems that you might be interested in looking in a little bit deeper is neurosis anything new on Netflix like back in the day when they first start liking people's first start looking at your Netflix kind of thinking of them as computational model today's Euro net worth modern neural networks are in really like biologically possible in any way straight so they're not really models of of the brain but still interesting you're interesting connections and insights that could be used in neuroscience from the perspective of or from a ituno science so are you recommend taking kind of cross-section neuroscience courses with a I think someone who works in this area if you're interested in looking deeper in courses so that was kind of a quick summary of what we have discussed so far in the class what are some next courses you're interested in taking sing deep around them if you're interested in learning more round and come with me but for the rest of the class what I want to do is I want to just do a quick like history of AI and then after that was just talked about what is the problem what is left but what is difficult so don't want to spend a bit of time on that what side history of AI so birth of a talk about the steering the overview like this was the first light came in and how do they the birth of the IRA you like people refer to it as this workshop that happened in 1950s this was a summer school in Dartford and basically everyone famous in the field showed up to this workshop including people like John McCarthy more people showed up to this to the summer school and the reason for the summer school was under standard general principles of Intel so what they really wanted to do with you wanted to figure out all the features of Intel and if they could formalize that they could go ahead and like seeing my dad and half that is what they really want I don't work I was really useful because after that these people went back to raise and then started doing really cool stuff and this was the first rise of AI and any started seeing things like problem-solving type typed type systems things like Samuels checkers program which was able to cannot beat a strong and reliable are saying other types of problem-solving programs like theorem provers and then people like stutterer using logic as a way of thinking about AI and thinking about problem solving that was really exciting because people like at the time for something that dissolve sailing logic is there people had all these programs they were super excited about the potential that these systems can be here are some of the coats from people are on that time things like machines will be capable within 20 years of doing any work a man can do so this is what Herbert Simon Marvin minsky said within 10 Years the problems of artificial intelligence will be substantially solved call Shannon said I visualise a time when we will be too robot with dogs are to humans and I'm rooting for the Machine no news really happened with one thing to notice is Fathers of the people who like in in it's like I like looking at the inside like what we can do and what we can do and it's interesting that even like them like I had always like overrunning Optimus Ireland so there was a lot of optimism here and then we started seeing really underwhelming what about autism government came in government was like here's my money take my money go do stuff and basically the problem that government was really excited about machine translation Annan the outcome of dad was something like this so so that's like a good xx and people started the feeling like these types of problem solving algorithms are not so so I made a point than the government funding and this was the first winter of AI problem-solving that summer school lots of excitement and then it didn't really work when it came to machine Translate one thing that I want to point out is a good voice for AI right now like right now it's all over this is from Royal Moira return to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and actually underestimate the effects of think about any system that it's always like all within two years it's going to solve everything and it's not everything within two years but if you would have what it has achieved in 20 years is actually she's a lot of things I'm usually underestimate dad and I think it's the same thing with a I like you're going to sing over going to have the time it starts tomorrow by 2020 I said you're going to have it on with Cars by 2020 and I first started working on that that's next month can have it on with Karzai 2020 but you're going to feel at the minute it's like you you're seeing a lot of improvements in terms of the organs under the system that you're developing so so thinking general should be aware of that and it should be should be smart about it but what can we do to actually address these problems and I'm going back to this first era of a problem-solving year era why did it work well the reason I didn't work we had limited computational limited info this is the thing that we actually started this class off it's changed that much right but with the thing that has changed over the years we have lots and lots of computation yet what's up what's of data and that's the thing that has really made it bigger difference here and that's one of the reasons I didn't but even though he had his family and we had this first winter of a lots of interesting contributions from that era the list programming language came out around that time garbage collection came at that time time sharing really interesting foundational ideas a computer science in merge during this period and this is keep her down that you're using in this class thinking about separating model and get in friends that actually came much are on the same like the fact that we should have this model thing and at the same time does procedural inference algorithm kind of separated from each other and think of them as separate things like a huge contribution that came after on that that was kind of price up and down a first up and down the second race of a I was around 70 this is when the knowledge-based systems came out experts and I would argue that the reason that we had the second brightest was people people started thinking about AI differently like originally people wanted to build artificial intelligence because you were interested in they're interested in understanding intelligence that's kind of what the summer school but at this point people were not interested in intelligence with the registered in which is building really useful systems that can do things I didn't care until and that's why we had this write-up expert system so I can be think about using domain knowledge to have things like if the Norfolk statements like if we have a premise then we have some sort of conclusion and and building is expert expert systems allows us to do a lot of core tasks in in a real rosso like he had actual impact around this time and things like answering my call or structures like diagnosis diagnosis of blood infections things like converting customer orders and important specifications so actual applications in the road people started taking it off then I'm thinking about the expert knowledge are you having that particular application and formulating Dad and expert based and I'm putting in a tie on top of it that does actual actual does that was really cool that the contribution of this area is that first off you had real applications that actually impacted in the store and the stormy night she idea I'm going to pick the domain just no it's actually going to help me make exponential growth was the saying that that was really Powerful but why don't work this was so the s a i came because there was a lot of frogs what are the problems was no ID in general it's not the term write like we have a lot of uncertainty when you think about knowledge and I knew sister was wearing not able to like in cold uncertainty the way you want it I need addition to that information if you think about any of these expert systems that requires a lot of effort to write down his roles and all these relationships between all this difference of parts of so an example of that is straight Louis Louis one of the first natural language understanding programs computer program this was written by Terry winograd without Stamford I think it was when he was MIT and any created assistant is computer program very hard this black rolled environment and you can actually have a person that interacts with this computer program and maybe the person says pick up a book red block and a computer says ok because the computer understand would like the relationship between small and read and different colours and Roblox RP at what time you pick still working right so this had a whole bunch of relationships and and rules around around it and any good actually Converse something tutor programme that was really but even turn himself like a couple years after I had the statement talking about his worries about how how are programs that you are not going to solve the problem they're not going to go all the way like you're saying this is kind of aiden.ai and I'm thinking about this complex interactions there just it just doesn't seem to be able to write down or rules that you would have between each one of yourself parts with other parts and there is no use so this why people were thinking this complexity barrier is not going to really allowed to say I systems to call Biggs certainly had the second winter of AI and then finally that rise of AI that you're so on and got those words again is this modern view of AI that started around 1990 this morning I don't reason that we had this new right is due to too many what is the idea of using probability and this is actually a girl who was very adamant about using bayesian networks in AI tomorrow answer settee finally people over able to to use probability to bring ideas from tomorrow because if you're a member of expert systems are super deterministic like we don't really have a way of talking about uncertainty prosci dia was vet spring powerboat anus but actually talk about uncertainty and what have the second reason is machine learning right so so so so inventing support vector machines 22-in parameters and then from that point on we started seeing the rise of networks and the fact that you have WhatsApp what's update on now and that can actually help us those better tomorrow is 22 big new viewpoints in a I have started seeing all these advances and what point I just want to make at the end of this is is there are you really a melting pot of a bunch of ideas from different Fields like a not all these are from puree I like everything about base Roses come from probabilities with squares come from and first-order logic maximum likelihood from statistics we have ideas from neuroscience econ optimisation algorithm algorithm Theory control theory like we can see my evaluation that came from Bowman from the field theory so it's really like if you think about it just brings all these different ideas from different Fields together to solve this AI problem and in general I think it's a good idea to be mindful dad and to be open today the new insight and ideas really come from like adding this proud of you of things can I have the boundaries if we between different fuels are really superficial and don't really need to be alright so spell the history of like downfall Rise downfall and and does this last so so what's this think of little bit about what have YouTube what are the cool things you've had in the past couple years and then what can go wrong and what should you be worried ok I think I've argued enough that AI is is being used in consumer service in advertising in Healthcare transportation manufacturing and it's going to make decisions now right cos I could have shown all these alternative and because of that but you're using AI distaste to make decisions for us to make decisions for education to make decisions for credit employment advertising Healthcare all these different does making decisions then recently be really careful about how high is unaffected you think about all the possible things that could go wrong understand the system for before making it like this so what is computed massive you've seen in recent years is this Google new machine advance when it comes to machine translation the ideas you could have lots of different languages and you can have a way of translating myself from Korean to English and English to Korean you can have a lot of date on that and that would be great and then maybe can have Japanese to English and English to Japanese and train on that and that's what have they done that's all then what you can do is I can actually go from Korean to Japanese without having any day that just goes directly from Korean to Japanese and that's kind of exciting right that you have had a data for that and if you're putting all this together then you can actually make a lot of advances in terms of language Iran 2016 what's the excitement language translation just became so much better there is no problem here is one of them so here is the problem of bias let's say that you're starting from language like Hungarian that doesn't have Jen and then you start from this language and then you go to English language that has gender and this is a translation that you're going to get you're going to get shoes in there and he was like and Anne and shoot she's a baker and 40 so you're going to get like all these like gender that's your dad there's no reason for just clicking the add and assuming that the algorithm is neutral there is no reason for it to pick up like these particular generous but the reason and it's picking up these tumors Adidas the algorithm has learnt to pick up pick up panda and so it's going to pick up the Spires and sometimes even free set a ribbon see all sorts of this weird behaviour I will experience Spires behaviour with actually be aware of this if you're building these types I need an addition to buy Aspire so I can explain it good weird behaviours that are even harder to explain so you might have a text that looks like they're some dog dog dog dog dog and then I could be just just translated 22 like something else that is kind of so understanding what goes on a lot of times with these kind of black box system is a little challenging anything goes a lot of research around trying to better understand and give transfer understand that was there was there was translation another example is image image classification has just become so much better over the years around 2015 it just hit human performer image classifiers are just much better than humans and and that is amazing right the guys really exciting perception is a difficult problem if I can do image classification that I can use this system to real-world like this sounds like my phone or myotonic his car and that's really excite but then again no whatever issues around what are the issues we actually discuss in the first lecture is the idea of having adversarial right so I can have Alexa assistant those image classification and Alex said is going to classify these images on the left but then when I can do it I can add today and when you add this noise to the picture you can get the stuff picture and that kind of looks like a school bus to me I don't I can tell the difference between the first and third picture when was going to happen at Alex that is going to predict ostrich for all of the pictures on and on so that not great having this address examples it's not that great because the system is not really but throw your AI based image classifier is not very robust when it comes to this Madras another an actor this is what came out basically people started writing all sorts of papers about how to create adversarial examples and how to be robust torch that particular Irish really sample and a Breaking Bad again and creating more about a lot of back and forth my favourite flavour is actually around this area I came out this year so this is from show me another and what they have shown is for specific network when you have what if Sean is what you can do as I can always make the system classify the number ones in this case as something else example so this is this I have numbers in it from 01234 10 numbers here and what's your numbers have shown as you can pick this 7 and you have 10 classes so you needed me 11 pixels to pick 11 pixels the day they picked a woman pixels carefully so it's not any pixels pixels and change it as much as there are some photos you and then the seven is going to be classified as so you can make the 7 be classified as any of these numbers 0123456789 I just picking the right 11 pixels to Wi-Fi and he tell you why like crazy give me anything I will create adversarial example for u222 just misclassified as something else presumptions that I haven't discussed one of these functions is the way your modifying is pixel is unbounded in this picture so it the greens and reds or just very high and variable so it does not actually between 0 to 255 it's number greater than 255 and less than 0 but they've actually shown that if you want to have more than 11 pixels by 20 pixels you could actually fitted between 0 to 255 to make it like what's a workaround what's the exciting work and practical work thinking about adversarial examples when it but yet what are the implications of this why are we so scared of this because all these systems are going to run on our phones doing image recognition and our cars doing recognition of our vehicles and they can easily be like they can easily be at group Berkeley dance group what they did was they had to stop signs and stickers and start again the stickers are at the right place at the place they wanted it to be within the stop signs or are not classified as like a spirit the score or here's another example another work really have these pictures and you put this funny glasses on them and then you put the glasses on the pictures than they are classified as so can easily attack these system sister Sister and I can actually affect the security of your vehicle or your image another example that's pretty challenging is around Reading so so what is Reading comprehension so remember your situ or do you like I pick Sam you have a text and you have to read that text and you have to answer do you have a question so the number of new Huguenot cornice decline after this is a thing you've got hey Google put on the system birth which is actually really amazing we can do this this reading comprehension and inverting answer this question perfectly it's going to say 1700 and that's great what ocean is it could actually just add an extra sense at the end of the text that has nothing to do with the rest of the text like that I something to beat Hazard it doesn't have to do anything with this particular question that's asked and now Bert is going to respond 6 easily trick the system and the Radio 3 is just not the same way that humans are too and that is I guess weird to people and that is something that you're doing with you another example another example I want to briefly talk about it mercede of optimising for a quick so so very good Z I think we should be doing right so sometimes the objectives that we have the reward function your riding crisis then we know what it is one of the machine translation we know exactly what we want to do and it's very clear but something to clear white mission the optimising Facebook they want to make money like this sad and ethical rewards for trying to put it and what could be the effects of optimising let's I have a reinforcement learning algorithm making your own personal learning algorithm that wants to ask him and I and I have my own Facebook account and it's autumn icing clicks from so this reinforcement learning algorithm would it can do it it can wear natwar mean if I show outrageous article is more likely to click on this article and then I'm going to get more rewards because I'm off to my thing for a that dog that expect with another thing that the reinforcement learning out with them B often figure out is that if I show outrageous articles to dorsa is going to become more and more outrageous and then I'm going to go because I'm going to removing because these systems are not interacting in a closed-loop interacting with other systems like human were offered changing Rose adapting and under system through this all hours and it's still could figure out how to change me to write outrageously and then you end up in a situation right now it's very bipolar because you're optimising for a quick so it's quite interesting to think about what are the Egyptians should be automating in world are we dealing with you're not always looking at Pac-Man well that we can control everything like usually this distance are running in a real Society burger people being affected by them and they responded to change and there is the changes in the response is going to affect things even more so so it's interesting to think about these feedback I'm speaking of humans I think another thing and another question that comes up usually when it comes to what is it that hue like in general even even in the case of robotics the big problem I have a robot arm and I want my robot off to pick up pick up this article that's all I want this is the thing that near the human want but I wonder Robert the robot are to pick up this mobile so back in the day this was called good engineering engineering was put engineer's with write down the correct report from the correct objective and the robot are we go and pick up you and everything with do promise that doesn't always work while it's really hard to write the correct function and get the robot do that and because of that people are more interested in trying to do things around imitation learning or things are on preference-based warning you just try to learn from how humans do it but how a human would do this as opposed to just the human sitting down and saying all this is the objective I want you to pick up pick up the robot because the robot might end up doing very weird an example that commonly comes up as this vacuum cleaner example you have a vacuum cleaner you have a robot vacuum cleaner that wants to clean your house and your objectives for the vacuum cleaner is to suck up that cancel radioactive everything is grey and one way that the vacuum cleaner could suck updated it could just go to please suck up to put it out and just keep doing that obviously you didn't want to because you don't want to do that that wasn't the thing you were thinking with the objective of ghost another behaviour I could end up as you could have your vacuum cleaner and your bag and cleaner B Off could just break its own bike sensor so it doesn't start now you're good because there are no there's around because I can't see them I'm going to close my eyes so I can't see the dirt so I'm not going to say anything so all these are things around if you just right there were watching that you think the robots should optimise it's not necessarily going to work and thinking about what are some good adjectives really difficult interested in my group actually another word that has recently came out on this is this work by this new book by Stuart Russell on human compatible and then basically what stored is arguing is is the fact that there is a mismatch between what humans actually want what is it worth watching it in their head and then what is it that the AI system were the robot thinks the human want and then those two are not always the same thing and that could cause a lot of interesting book what else can go wrong so generating fake content that was the thing that came out of cover yours sorry to create like a video star just or images that work exactly like like Obama and you can and then that again raises an ethical question right just because you can build it should you build a door you can create that's fine but should we do it just because we can do it another place at this question comes up and I doing crazy guys in general think about that in your future like you can do something but you do build it and another place is comes up is in a tonne so having a military and then thinking about having a time as weapons can how it happens if you don't have system that automatically detects and automatically do the job right I do that so we do it should we have a timer does there need to be a person in the world and so just thinking about it we do not we never wanna have a time and we always want to have a person in the but why I got what is it about the person Debbie wants to be in like that kind of pills I said there is something about the person maybe sympathy maybe something about why people know why people have their autonomy system doesn't have an understanding that I think is a very interesting problem and around it's like if you don't have them what countries have them like how we go about it and what's up generally doing great you think about somebody's ethical aspects of building alright next stop furnace so on so far is the big problem I think I'll have you know this already right so so we might have a classifier that majority of data said perfectly separate your majority of data such as the picture and the law and then you might have some data points from the group and and the classified as exactly the opposite thing for them so sorry for you if you put all these dealers together then you're probably going to get a classifier that looks like the first one and it's just not going to work on the minority data said and and that is kind of applications like have different populations and I dropped my axe very differently on different popular and the question is how should we address these furnace questions my way to go about it is it's so so you might have two classifiers and both of them I give you 5% one of them could give you 5% and you don't want to give you 5% systematic and I think it's pretty important to think about if you're getting systematic or random error and what type of what population are you getting and and that could address some of these questions are answered there's a lot of work actually around for anaesthesia conference around the furnace accountability and transparency this is work by Maurice heart so if you're interested in this people work at someone work from home another example for this I think we talked about this in the overview lips is around us criminal risks so so northpoint as a company that without the system called contact and we can't pastors is it predicts if a criminal is going to reoffend the risk of a criminal reoffending and it's going to give a score of 1 Sociedad weather and anybody actually been used and what happened was Republic of which is a non-profit came out under the study and probably show that given an individual did not reoffend how many Americans were twice likely to be wrongly classified 5 or 8 text of the data SIM propublica by using this criteria the North Point actually did North End cities and they showed that because we are looking at this definition definition of furnace is that given a risk score of 7 60% of whites reoffended and 60% of blacks reoffended so wondering that we get the same percentage to be fair and that's our furnace furnace property we do satisfied this kind of definitions can I make a group of researchers and from different places to start thinking about definitions up and what they've actually shown us that these two definitions of furnace they are now going to be satisfied at the same time they're always going to go against each other we can have both of them at the same time if that is the case then what is the right definition of furnace that we should you try if you can have both of those at the same time then how do we make sure that we can use this ever use this system Soham what's an interesting questions about formalizing furnace home around gold here in the CS department were colada on the furthest from the algorithm side of things so if you're interested in going back to the city or algorithms and the people who haven't taken from classes REI classes not really no because by Design really want them to pick up Paris that's what they're good at the good at eating of Paris and why there's an alternative weird things that we see in Our Data that is in Our Data and pick them up and then enforce them and that's why received item are Griffin's and all these issues are on Furnace and security and all these other things in Our Data and then another problem that comes up as this feedback I was talking about earlier right so so you're putting out in those patterns if they have biases the putting out those why is in a world where there are humans and humans are observing those biases and can get even more biased and give more biased data and then this could be like this feedback loop that could go forever so again regarding be really careful that what you're putting out and and what it how is affecting the biggest Society next stop is privacy I guess I have a couple more things around another another thing another issue in general is this privacy rights over losing a lot of data and and and and in general some of them could be could be sensitive data and we don't want actually revealed that so she said one way to address that is instead of putting out the actual putting out the right statistics that gives us the right information so for example you might want to compute the average statistic like if you're asking me someone has Cancer or not instead of getting yes just you might just need the average statistic and that would just be enough for you so so so in general in your colour can cater you should you could randomise your data or you could change your data so so you can get the average statistic as one way of protecting Prime another way of protecting privacy is in general randomise respond I have a question of what you have that is a question you can ask a user and using my Note 10 review exactly if they have a sibling stop the 1-hour a responding that is the user with flip 2 coins and then if both of them compared then they can say answer yes no random otherwise they can answer yes no true so so based on the answer that you get from 40 core user you wouldn't be able to tell but if that particular user is going to have when you could actually compute the true probability because I observed this probability 3-ft of the time they're telling you the truth 14th of the time they're telling you randomly so so that you can recover the truth and that is probably enough for like the title so so random as responses in general it could be one way of going about somebody's private another issue that comes up is is causality so little little bird in in the variable base model tried so so you might want to look at the facts of something you want a weekend effect of treatment on Survival and this is your day so you have for untreated patients 80% of them survived and 432 patients 30% this is so the question is does treatment help how many everything so the answer is actually turn off because well if you think about it 6 people are probably more likely to take treatment like 6 people or more likely to undergo treatment than the material you like fix the state or like it's face and eye treatment because your your day darling your sister's extra you didn't really consider the fact that those people and they were sick so you have to actually consider that how the thickness is it going to the rate of servile War Anand the last briefly interpretability vs Aki you've seen this rise of neural networks and what about applications and most of them or not safety-critical really saying like things like your network safety-critical application in cars what aeroplanes or types of safety-critical systems hope you're sick and in one question that always comes up should we use this system in safety-critical settings because as you're using them to lose interpretive so notice work by Michael cooking their first Group where they are basically looking at air traffic control and and and they're looking at the system that runs on aircraft and I'm previously it was basically a bunch of Rules that the system needed to follow but it wasn't like that interpret and understand what it does and in the systems that are passed since with you but Michael has been working with this new system called a class and aquatics you were they are basically trying to replace that with just that for my conversation Francis that the does the same job but it is not necessarily the doesn't have nestorius a mobile interpretable accurate can prove that network right it is saying that you can actually like a numerator and the question what are we going to put in on our safety news transfers if you lose interpretability or we still reeling to like with these systems that do think they are statistically more and in general how can we increase interpretability and transparency of bugs already systems that your building because that is useful top players in ft and then what is different government also think that in 2016 the White House put out an article about someone and a lot of them were just around the Iso making your own research thinking about human collaboration thinking about ethical and legal and societal implications of a icts security systems so all of these things that you've been discussing so far or a really challenging problem 16-sided about them and everyone wants to put in put in water when you're ready in time in 1 minutes and then the document will be sucking big data and have the potential to eclipse long-standing civil rights protections in how personal information is used in automotive applications like housing credit Employment and so on and Americans relationships with should expand not diminish their opera some of the things that you have discussed so far right like biases furnace safety all these issues are not necessarily satisfying this last if your building is this sister we should actually be really careful about someone's implication and another was saying earlier like a round this there is a new conference conference Iran accountability and transparency and kind of the guidelines of of of the snooker munity that's been built around here is that we got nothing about the fact that there is always a human in that's behind these are so there's always a human ultimately responsible behind what is going to happen and then we can just say what the Elephant in general I guess it's like the wrong way of going is because they're the human decider one of you guys one of us right that's going to write this out with them and I do really want you guys I think about some of these principles as you go further in your in your career and then you think about building this sort of and just end positive there is enormous potential for actually positive in AI system please just use it response a dead A1 thank you guys for us to order and please go out the service
