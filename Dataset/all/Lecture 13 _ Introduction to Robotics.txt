this presentation is delivered by the Stanford centre for professional development ok let's get started so today's video is about juggling this is from then could it and it was presented at isrr international symposium on robotics research in 19 Michigan robotics laboratory work interested in tasks involving dynamically dexterous interaction between robots and their environment computers currently play chess better than all but a few of the best human experts but no machine has yet been built that community like the physical piece anywhere near the school and reliability of the youngest human chestnuts are 3 degree of freedom Direct Drive robot is Endowed with a juggling algorithm the Transformers the positions and velocities of a falling ball in the desired joint positions and velocities to track by using non-linear inverse Dynamics controller small position and velocity I produced by A linear Observer which in turn receives the input from a real-time stereo vision system the one jungletastic requires the machine about a single bowl into a stable periodic trajectory housing to a user-specified apex 8-ball with an independently specified Apex point defines a 2 dog attacks the juggling algorithm shown here employment agency manager switch the machines interest between the reference commands corresponding to the two independent one joggers it's word advertising that there is no planning in the conventional sense taking place in assist whether the robot impact decisions are induced by its continuous motions in the upper tract of carefully distorted version positions and velocities of the two balls machine juggling skills in themselves unlikely to play a direct role in The Social and economic impact of events I want to we are convinced that the problems of controlling contax orgasm visual attention emcor trading in real-time the constituent behaviours of such scale provide an invaluable laboratory for understanding what is hard about dynamical dexterity banana phase regulation control term the balls quickly wondering Booth and eventually phone simultaneously in contrast with Phase regulation again nearly simultaneously bowling balls are successfully separated in this experiment we failed with Anastasia collision we have enough you to better understand the nature of these and other dynamic in order to control around the more effective of course there will always be situation which machine can I recover ok so who's interested in juggling well that's what I'm interested in Dublin could try it next culture in experimental Factor a lot of for the projects in experimental robotics involved dynamic skills throwing a ball tabasco playing ping-pong or whatever Jacqueline is quite challenge well Jacklin requires control and here we are so this is a little bit of a council that we are going to see over the discussions on control and the concept is instead of really thinking about the robots are sore programmable machine where you need to find all the joint motions corresponding to your task so you want to move to some location and you want to be able to restart location with some orientation of your reflector well basically what you have to do is you have to solve this inverse kinematic problem to find the joint angles that will allow you to be in that I'm not sure if you're human do that human usually are really poor at competition so finding the inverse kinematics finding all the joint angle that way put you in that final configuration it's really so what do you think human do feedback of what so you you sort of like I tried to reach for something it's hard to reach for the like the chair in front of you how do you do it so you're looking at your hand you you look at the chair and you you have this visual feedback survey so it's sort of like your your hand is attracted by a force pulling you to that goal position you did this and this is because of you see her it's sort of like potential energy well the minimum of this potential energy is located at the gold position and that is going to create a force pulling your hand toward the goal your hand is going to move to the score without apiary imagining or knowing where your final configuration is going to be the final configuration is going to emerge from you will you come this to this later this kind of idea is really what we call task-oriented or operational space control radio really doing the control not through the inverse kinematic and programming model well there is another method and more robots today are controlled through inverse kinematics that is we control the joint match so you first decide where you're going to position your hand so you need to find this configuration with me you know what you know is the position and orientation of the head you don't know yep that's so you need to do the inverse kinematics inverse kinematic 4 six degrees of freedom inverse kinematic for this I'm not sure bed anyway you might maybe you was a mannequin and you you just position it and you decide well this is a good configuration and you start from here and now you suffer your joint angles to move to that final will it doesn't really work very well with a humanoid robotics and in fact a lot of humanoid robotics today or suffering from this problem the 5th we are still controlling robots using interest however for industrial robots Wordfeud number of degrees of freedom or if you have a repeatable you're repeating the same motion over and over basically you recorded the motion and what what is the offer is how to track that much so today we're going to discuss the basics of control and we going to restart slowly with something like we saw on the just natural you're dropping a bowl or you are looking at a pendulum moving and you are trying to understand just the relationship between the potential energy apply to the system and the kinetic energy resulting from its motion and then we will analyse how this behaviour would allow us to create something like PD control proportional derivative well in nature we don't have too much of a integral action but we will we will be able also to add integral action if the error is large and then we will apply this to controlling robots in joints so we can control this robot to follow a trajectory that is given in joints and then we will discuss how we can apply control techniques directly to the task in the way we we do it human that is by directly applying a force nut through the inverse kinematic or at the joints but directly controlling and affect your emotion velocity and acceleration so at the end we will see that motion control is not really the only thing we need to do when we have a robot you really need to interact with the environment and in order to interact with the environment you need to control the contact Force so if you are sliding over a surface you are moving and at the same time you are applying a force of counter that is going to be critical technique in order to interact with the world objects assemble and co-operate with a different truck stop how many people like this one can be controlled directly through its joint motion bye simply imagining that you have some sort of like Springs add the Giant and if you put just at spring then this mechanism is going to oscillate if you disturb so what do we need to add I'm just talking about passive mechanism so we we put that thing and now it's going to hold itself at some figures and if you disturb it well oscillate so what do we do to make Morley Santa Claus table put some damn so if you play a spring and a damper at each of the joint you will basically go to that resting point of all the springs m YouTube BR dot configuration right how to control the robot in joint space just imagine that the resting point of the spring is changing so little by little you're here and then you're moving it there and there and there and then you can control the joint so this is typically the approach that we will have in during space control except that we are not really dealing with the coupling within social forces create and we will see little bit more about this we will see why good work I mean it's not not obvious that is going to work in with passive with passive four devices if you put dust spring and damper the system is passive and it's going to somehow rest at some configuration there will be the fraction due to even actor steady state like it leather dress what what other forces will disturb the position soda Springs we'll go to the rest position that they will Vivian little because the Grove so the gravity will create little Mistress you need to compensate for the gravity to account for the gravity you need also doing motion but I can't 4 these acceleration you are generating and that are scaled by the initials and the masses so they produce coupling as well as centrifugal coriolis force so the equation of Dynamics is here and now we need to account for that but simply the concept of the control is just a spring damper system and the behaviour is going to be very close to our mass spring damper except affects you have couple so if we subtle and we want to control the robot directly in with respect to the so we want to move this interfactor to some location what can you do still using SunPass springs and Denver I'm going to give you one big spring and a damper and you just need to place somewhere yes baby position is good it will give us well the robot is and we know where the rabbit is going so we know the weather between the two but I'm asking what is the concert in term of moving I mean implementing controller that will work with the task instead of working with the giant so I don't want to use this if I place all the springs at the joints I need to know vagina space I need invoice Kinema if I want to control the hand no exactly I mean just pull it right just put the spring there anyway I give you only one spring I have two places so ok what is going to happen here is you are going to fall then deflector to that location to the resting position and do this and everything else you don't know where it's going to be but it's all and you will see that the concept is as simple as this well in 6 dimension ex-wife the spring is like 60 ok so this is basically the concept of task-oriented control I mean you can think about this thing at 3 classic spring or summer attractive potential energy that you are creating at the end of act with a gradient is wishing you towards the goal and that gradient is actually here coming from the spring the spring has a potential energy when it disturbed and when you go to Joris the minimum of that energy and essentially you're applying the gradient of the potential ok so injustice this is what is happening as I said we have an inverse kinematic problem we have it that is describe in terms of x y Z orientation of interfactor alpha beta gamma whatever presentation you have you need to compute the desires joint motions and then you have those desired motion one desired motion to etc and you look where you are so you measure from in quarters your q1q 2QN euphona small era between where you want to go and where you are and then you are reducing this error by control independent controllers most of the time sent to each of the jaw so you have several controller at each of the Jar taking the giant from some value of data to another value the problem is you have this invoice kinematic all the time the cyst another approach that game about as early as 69 70 71 and there is a paper by Dan Whitney in 72 describing resolved motion rate country so rate me we looking at the derivative and the velocity and the idea is do instead of doing the inverse kinematic using the forward kinematic and taking its inverse lady is to find a small displacement delta theta delta q that correspond to your Design displacement of facts so what do you think we have an hour in our menu as models that could help there so we would like to find the relationship between delta x small displacement so I'm at xx I would like to move l Belfast what would be the doctor so what model we should use and you don't say it someone else yes the jacobian actually do ingress of Vegeta so so here's the jacobian it relates precisely does the Accidental Theatre if your degree Inverness I have to make sure you're not other things already otherwise you have to do special treatment of the configuration if you're outside of the singularity will and if you you have six degrees of freedom regular case rectangle or a mattress then you can take the inverse otherwise you have to resort to July's inverses Citroen vs so you computers sulphur a small fireworks now you have your daughter knowing you are saved knowing you where you are the next configuration you want to go to his wealth play doubles bell diver so so you start from your current position axe U compute the error that is the XX desired - you current position and then you computer your daughter and your added data so you you keep controlling the robot today later + wishes where you were plus the small display and this is a fact here is the model now the jacobian inverse is inside your servo controller and you need to compute the forward kinematics which is easier especially for you now Forest hurricane American fugitive Ian you just have to invoice the inverter Jacobi and for tomorrow but you can get it almost in analytical form so basically you computer like you and you distributed to all the joints and you have control of four is it of the joint to move informed the Sarah in Love Actually and humour so now you continuously moving well this has a lot of problems in term of phone the conditioning of the jacobian the fact that did you call me in house this so train think about symmetric because the space where you are measuring golf bags involve linear motion in England so linear motion is measured in displacement in centimetres or metres or inches but it has also rotational motion measured in degrees or radians and it's all included in the jacobian so the metric of the jacobian is not homogeneous and that creates problems also you have the fingal 80s you have the redundancy you have all of that in addition to the fact that you have they mama so this works usually most of the time it works best if you use it to find the trajectory you want exact robots often you want repeatable treasure and this doesn't trip you will drift so if you do this installation you wouldn't be able to find out surgery so resolved the inverse kinematic this way and then come up with a trajectory that you can well let's see how we're going to control the robot anyway we get joint angles we are following directed the trajectory whatever we do we need to control the Robert we need to create a a Motors torque is proportional somehow to the air so should we drive the joints to move toward Google so how does it by the way how many of you have had some control class that's what they are so what was that assuming you know nothing forget everything now so what is the simplest system we can conserve well I think I'm spring system would be the simple you can in Bray so you have a mouse resting on a surface with zero friction nothing sliding and you have a spray u-pull-it what's going to happen Letterkenny imagine what's going to happen Farnborough you put little bit and let it go so we are really interested in understanding the fossil how the solution is affected by and by what so this problem could be resolved and looked at through the same equation we used to find the Dynamics we look at this mess and we find its kinetic energy and we look at the system it has some potential in York where is the potential energy it is I'm sorry I cannot hear answer will ring you I'm sorry I didn't lisp right so when you win when you actress the potential energy is equal to 0 I mean if you're late rest and alone you're not intervening 20 and the kinetic energy is equal 20 the velocity is the kinetic energy is 1/2 MV Square so if we disturbed and Holland what happens to the kinetic energy still there professor Leonard going to be positive it will increase now if we let go the potential energy start to decrease and it's that energy transferred to the kinetic and then think of the precinct we come to the minimum of the potential energy we will have the maximum kinetic energy and now the kinetic energy velocity start to reduce the kinetic energy review and we saw building potential in and essentially this oscillation is a transferred between k and V so this is k and we can write this equation so if you write this equation using K that we saw hire you think the derivative for this back to its dock it gives you what mx0 the derivative of k with respect to x is 0 so you go the Tandoori reading of 20 m x w equal f and the potential energy the spring is 1/2 kx square so that gives you the gradient when you take derivative with respect to x you get - chaos ok so MG equation is Newton equation in this disc mass acceleration equal force and the force is - KX conservative so you are transferring energy between - KX and the kinetic energy wishes building velocity and acceleration so for some reason straighten twice I don't know what happened why it's reading twice but now I move this minus KX to the left-hand side of the equation and we have mass acceleration Force KX = 20 so there is no external forces skx is the gradient of a potential energy V and this is the acceleration of your maths now take a look at the response of this stop not sure if you can see it you see this red potential energy all day this is the potential energy of the spring and let's imagine this green Dot that is this point mass we are going to drop so if we drop this Whitemoor is it going to 4 and it will oscillate there is no it was keep oscillating forever so this is time and we are looking at the frequency of crossing this axis that is we're going from one side ex we're going to the negative side and there is a frequency of course so my question to you is in relation to this to parameter k&m what is the effect of m on the frequency if your mass is heavy have your own hair what is going to happen to this freaking and if you k is smaller and smaller what is going to happen to this free ok is very big what would happen is 0 what is going on k0 nothing would happen hi k is larger the oscillation frequency so frequency increases with k and decreases where's the match there is this quantity that we call the natural frequency after system and this is √ k / 10 anyone knows why I mean where this Omega is coming from do you see it from the stop equation somewhere yeah so so basically yeah there's a play Staind you need to get a question and and analyse it's response if you don't trust this resource let's see how we can resolve integrate this equation so if we divide by n ouigo the acceleration + k / m no if you integrate this equation the you get the square root of professional facts that will appear and end we usually arrive this equation on the top Wheelwright it as Omega square x so the k / m is really the square a few natural frequency and if you write this equation and do the integration of this equation you get a seniors order response where Omega appears as the frequency of your sin is over match insight ex that comes from the integration of this equation is some constant cosine omega t class fight so what is 5 insee depends of what I heard initial so from the initial conditions of position and velocity can determine c&i and this is you and you can see that this Omega is strictly √ / well if you understand this we need just one more step and then you'll understand video TV control actually is imitating the natural system to create a spring the sky will become your stiffness k is this and M is the mass they will become your personal game and in few seconds we will few minutes we will see another key that involve the damping also come into the equation but not of Conservative system of the separatists system that dissipate energy because of fridge and then we will have the completed so if you are looking at only Conservatives system without any damping this is the response ok stop infer if we just add little bit of friction on underneath the mass as it's moving there will be some dissipation of energy and this dissipation with b a 4 opposing opposing what opposing the motion opposing the velocity so it's sort of mine Sam coefficient I'm expert and that fiction if we added to the system we have to add it on the right hand have they quiz the Lagrange equation is capturing the natural system on the left side on the right side we are putting a natural force which is fiction but we cannot put it in this left side of the equation because dispose is not conservative it is not a potential energy force it cannot be integrated in so it appears on the right hand of the an external friction Force applied by the environment on the hob and if we assume that this force is simply proportional to the velocity it could be non-linear friction can be non-linear can have column friction you can have stiction all kind if you add this first to the previous equation that we have appears here this is a second order equation general form of the equation my sister is not anymore conservative because if you are so late now you're going to lose energy and little by little you lose energy and then you stop so the mass acceleration + BX + KX is the general form of a linear system the second order and if we did this system and analysing so what we do we divide by the mass do you see Omega Square now so we have Omega Square Ender thank you very much Finnish can continue now what we're going to do with b / m well when we integrados equations this term is going to appear in some form so what we would like to do is to to see how he is affecting the stampy when's does it if you put a large be very very large and you start falling you're falling you're falling well if he is very what are you going to cross you will just asymptotically reach that goal position without Cross so you have sort of an over them sister if he is very small you're going to oscillate and eventually you will lose the energy and you will converge towards the minimum of the image so here is an oscillatory dance system with higher values of b / m we have anova than system and as we moved from here to here there is a special value at wish we just go and reach the X Factor and this value is called the critically dances and remember this we going to use it a lot because we try to imitate this behaviour when we control any of the systems we will try to make it critically damped sis so we need to know for which value divided by this value this is state and the value of b / m is simply to omega so when b / m is equal to Omega in Omega is √ k / m well then we have a critically damped system and discounts just simply from the integration of the equation this condition so now you can compute be be the critically damped B is equal to what come on to Omega and x if you know your mass if you know you're ok then you can compute your B2B again for your control system here be is the natural damping the invent so the system is that so let's take this to a mega in end try to make it explicit in that first equation I'm going to take this equation and I'm going to write it as a function of omega and as a function of this critically discuss so to do that we take b / which is the value the value we have right now and comparing 2 value that will give me critically damped behaviour ok so b / m is compared to critically damn be / am so this is a sort of fresh right damping ratio end well I need to replace be / by something that may Omega in appear so I need to divide by this and x you agree so I'm the best I have this ratio and we called this the natural damping ratio and we use this cymbalta represented what do you call the simple symbol Psy we use a Sira present the natural damping ratio it's by / m / 2 so4 which value the natural damping ratio gives me critically dancers ok 41 when Zeta and is equal to 1 it means that be is simply twice √ km and for this value I will be able to have a critically damped system ok so far so good not too confused so introduce to notions introduce the natural frequency √ 3 / 10 and we introduced the natural damping ratio this be divided by 2 √ Ko ent now we can analyse our system and write it in this phone so the acceleration it's mpharm activation with / n and weekend write the equation in this way we can ride it acceleration omega velocity Omega Square velocity is equal to 0 now the time response of the system requires to integrate this equation and if we integrate this equation we will have response because of the damping useinsider Eden andalou to the same as all is reduce as you move there is a decrease and this decrease is exponential this decreased depends on later and Omega you have this in his own motion which is function of your natural frequency omega but it's also functions of your damping ratio you can see when zita is equal to 1 this will become 0 because 9 of 0 and if it's greater than that is no cosine because you will have only the explanation so here is the response so you have missed exponential you have the frequency that is now function of omega in √ 1 - zetime data Square that is the period 2 pi Omega and √ 1 - 0 in square so it's not Omega in anymore Omega anyways the natural frequency the Moose thing that appears there is sort of a natural frequency that is affected by the dumping so we call it omega the damped natural frequency Omega natural frequency and now it is bent alright I think this is the last definition you need to remember Android this weekend do it almost everything except the nonlinearities we have to deal with little later omega when you have them being is really Omega and the national frequency that appears in your spring failed by √ 1 - 0 wish.com Slater square which comes from you're damping b / the mouse and the the the spinc or the game of ur ok so these are characteristics of a second order system and what we need to do is to just inspire HR control by this and then we will be able to recreate bad behaviour simply Be selecting collecting what by the way so if you start with them and now you want to create a system like this what do you need to select you need to survive the spring wishes k the stiffness of the spring and you need to select me so by selecting b&k you can create the second-order behaviour on a mouse so if you have one joint with some miniature to create a behaviour like this a closed-loop behaviour of second-order natural frequency song damping ratio and someday natural frequency you should be able just to select b&k and find your sister ok so really the control of a system is going to be almost the same we are going to Omega we are going to be determined k&b and then you will be able to control the close-up yet will be will be is a function of the right right b b could be actually the most general form of B is B is function of x and x and even higher-order and then what you get is you do not get a linear system you get an onion so there will be additional disturbances on the system and you need to do thing to do two things either tomorrow your fiction and then try to compensate for that and that's what we're going to do for centrifugal force that's what we're going to do for the find out the mass is configuration different but once you modelling you can integrate the Marvel in your control and you can compensate for non-linear men at the end after compensation you come to this phone a linearized phone so what you going to do actually later is to go and compensate for the gravity compensate for centrifugal coriolis forces compensate for nonlinearities like friction and then Reed I love all we have simply a decouple system with Mr and Mrs that we we can control using this no compensating for friction is very dangerous it's not easy you cannot just go and like do some estimate and compensate for the you can come from for the friction and I can try composite if you want I'll show you how dangerous it is the hits what is the name of this robot the polar ok let's move it it's moving well it has some fiction what's this is this fiction it has you say I'm moving it and it has written because it has natural fit in but if I remove the strip ok now I remove the fridge look what's going to happen I'm going to play a small Force are you alright we're going to work we saved so so you can see if you come possible for the friction you you start to have you will have quickly oscillations and you will have instabilities so let's say lightsaber robot is it's control now with those things you have 400 400 this are the value of the spring and you have some value for the bees basically in here 40 this is gen 3 so if we change this to the Lyca 40 you see I'm pulling now it is it is little bit moving you can see join three if I put on joint to little stiffer 3 is responding I mean if we can if we can reduce this game to make it on 4 is good stop that's too much snake 4 now it's easier to move but you see the damping it's still like over them when you move it it is not responding so let's make this very small now there is little bit of Motion if we make this 0 so now if we stop putting negative damping to compensate for the natural friction we're going to go and stable so this is small amount how about -9 ok and are you still going to go and stay the real time is not real that's why it is little bit weird but it is so so don't try this no negative them what's something positive don't think it's free ok so so remember this song omega is it bigger or smaller then Omega n so you get your Omega in from √ / m and now your omega after damping is ok I don't look now at please I'm not hiding you have the answers think about this what is urine damp natural frequency we just sad lyrics so don't look at your nose ok try to compute it so have you confused you're definitely see you need to compute the and then put natural frequency the natural frequency is what / 2 square root is 2 your your damping ratio is what B slash where route of Cologne Cayenne km is 16 square root is 4 who is Ade oh come on I'm not going to this ok so this is your Omega you're right this is your later is it's easy to remember b ÷ 2 km square Carlisle Motors remember that angel Omega is 1 points so you reduce it from 2 to 1 points so we have another video segment next time that we will skip it now so we have a little bit more time so I'm going to to go over 1 degree of freedom that we are going to control exactly as we did with Asif so one degree of freedom robot we going to assume that the robot has just inertia or maybe I'm off sliding maybe vs better if we take up there's nothing joint prismatic joint is going to involve just the mass of the moving link and we're going to move it with a horse and we are going to create this first as a spring and now we want to move to some location so that would be the resting position of the spring and then we can recreate exactly the same behavior on the robots so here is the the one link robot it's just simply a lot probably this is the simplest that you can imagine it is a mass moving on the force of the motor so the motor is going to fight or translated into a force app and you want to move it from its current position 2 x Deezer ok simple problem so we have mass acceleration equal Force so now you're 40 is your motif and you your task is to create a force that will let you move this prismatic joint from its current position do the God position desire stop the same thing as a spring what we're going to do is we are going to create this spring or potential energy whose minimum is at exodus so the potential energy that you're creating is positive everywhere except add XD is equal to 0 it's 0AT your desired position and it means that you can have something like a quadratic potential energy with some game Katie which produces a gradient that is equal to what what would be the gradient of this potential energy it should be what so you take partial derivative with respect to x and that would be ok x X Minus x Deezer so your system is simply mass acceleration Force kpx - x Deezer here we have the zero of the spring movie changing with your desired position and that doesn't change anything but just changes this year so instead of talking about stiffness we are going to talk about the game that you are using for your hair in position so we call it position game and immediately we can go to the question and analyse what happens if I apply disk controller and why what is this controller is going to be stable or not we can go go and do this analysis on your on the question of flag rash on that's it and we analyse what happens when we apply a force that is the Greedy of this potential energy potential energy is is there we took the gradient of the potential energy and wake up light now going from this place to this page is interesting because here I was looking at just one degree of freedom and if we go here we can sort whatever the number of degrees of freedom if we buy a controller like this essentially so this could be six degrees of freedom 20 degrees of freedom whatever the number of the liver in the system if you potential energy is in this phone and if you are applying a force that is the gradient of that potential energy then what you can do is UC you see this equation here you're applying this first there well you can move to the left side and now you have your potential energy in this equation so what is happening here is that you would like rather questions showing you that you have a system on the left-hand side that involves only kinetic energy and potential energy eco 200 sunroof Force so what do you expect in term of the stability of the cyst so if you have a mechanical system on potential energy and kinetic energy with no external forces Nike son of force because all the forces are conservative or gradient so what we can say about this issue it is stable so simply by selecting your control your motor controls to be the Greedy a potential energy you guarantee that your system is going to be stable so this is a very important result because now we we know that if we use this phone of control setup proportional to the area wishes the derivative of a potential energy then we are going to be stable now stable is not sufficient because it can be a solitary stable actually this system we know the response of going to a solid so this force is sufficient what should we do we should add some damping we should ask from dissipative Force so in here I'm going to change this zero with some damping Reigate with all of them so this force is in the potential and cannot move to the left it is going to be there and I'm going to put an external the sympathy for I'm going to put a damping Force but I need to know in which condition what are the conditions on this Force what conditions are required in order to make the system aesthetically stable what does it mean at some to take this table by the way you understand what was it means so this is the behaviour of oscillation that are done critically or over there your system will converge toward the goal and reaches that goal what we are trying to achieve and this dissipative force that we Saab V4 was doing something to the system do you remember someone here said something about that for that horse was doing something to the motion or so what is the condition on FS that is the question has to oppose the motion right so if you are moving in some Direction you should oppose that much so what would be the simplest way to do that FS should be if your motion is measured with a velocity expert so if you are in higher dimension basically this could be afford that is opposing your velocity ent what you need to do to make sure of is what in order to oppose the velocity that the dot product between the two Factor is negative so if you fall the product with the velocity is negative for any no 0 velocity you are Atlantic Estate medicine stop come on pick up one force that that satisfy this condition the simplest one you just said so you can pick minus KV explained whiskey positive that will satisfy this condition so if we are fly there FS equal to this linear damping then eventually we take this control the Conservative Party of the force and activate the damping pot ok these two pieces represent the PD control proportional delivered so if you want to move to a goal position all what you need is a term that captures this error disco position could be far away Eva so it's like a step response you're you're stepping x to this composition and your you have damping that is trying to reduce 0 because here you could have expect - desire that's because you are not talking at visit to you I'm just going to a GoPro session you want to stop at the go position so it's like that - 0 ok this is the PD control now how we design dyscontrol how epkt howitt KV depends on the similar similar characteristics we studied just earlier with passive system and dissipative system natural sis so the KP is going to be big so that KP / n the mass of the system gives you the Omega that you wish so when you are controlling your robots do you wish to have a smaller Omega a larger make what Omega does to the response omega smalling if you want to move from here to here with small omega you takes long long time so usually what match faster response if you want to match your service what I mean if you want to move slowly not only the time response but also the stiffness of your system because your stiffness is depending on KP your disturbance rejection is depending on KP Google we will analyse KP and see why we want higher Katie we will analyse KV and its limitation and we will see how we picked dusky peace and cavies for giving performance of omega and data on one
