this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development good afternoon my name is Sir Chris milk I am going to be teaching the lecture today I'm also the author of the notes for the course so if you have any complaints there at the to me if you have any praises directed To A salmon I did my pasty here at Stamford about 16 years ago and so is in your shoes and I've been kind of doing fuel at us as well as some of the classes completely since and I'm not working in the robotics area right now staying pretty current in there the the topic of the lecture today's project regeneration and it's a quite relevant to the video that you're so because in addition to the control functions of the sensor functions of the underground that the underlying mathematics is really planning for a path before object among other objects in the that's basically trajectory planning and so what we going to be talking about today is really the basic Mathematics and they can be used at higher level planning including the one with the navigation vehicle so we going to define the project first so we have a manager later on and it's starting we want to move the minute later on from some initial position downloaded with the French piece of to some go position which will be the desired position to Subsea in the manipulator has is based in a stationary frame which is ass in this so you want to plan a motion for the manipulator from eBay to disappear in addition to make things more interesting we might have to go through some intermediate points I like for example disobey and we have that because if we have an environment with obstacles and the manipulator is moving in that environment you want to make sure that you're avoiding the obstacles the in which case you're introducing intermediate points for the manipulator to move so this is the basic problem symptomatology we have cash points the initial the final point and the via points that will be going through and then what we want to plan is the trajectory that trajectory in the simplest case is a time history of the position velocity and acceleration for each of the degrees of freedom for the purpose of this lecture and basically discuss will be planning each of the degrees of freedom independently and then assume that the motion is realizable as the hole OK they go Swansea put them all together it's spelt getting very cold so Furniture the degrees of freedom will be planning the project what kind of constraints do we expect to see so they can be special constraints obviously obstacles in the environment that we don't want to collide with a time constraints of the motion has to be done in a particular time frame for it especially if we have a industrial operation that we are trying to achieve and everything is going on a conversion you have to do it in a particular time and smoothness you want the manipulator to have a smooth Mouse because that uses much less energy and it's easier to control so these are the type of constraints that will be so that's the sun for pretty much everything that will be discussing initial point gold point intermediate points constrain and we're going to be chatting the time from a mathematical point of view it's very simple problem we're planning path we can look for the solution in several spaces 2 main spices and there is the joint space for the manipulated that's the nativespace for the manipulator so we want to go in that case it is easy to go through this intermediate because we will know exactly what the joint configuration is going to be for the Robert in this intermediate point I'm so at this point in order to get the actual joint characteristic will be solving the inverse kinematics at all the PowerPoint and then we'll plan for a motion so let's say we have the coordinates of the points that we want to pass through we solve the inverse kinematics for all this target points we get the corresponding joint Corden and then we plan in joint space Project so that's a pretty simple and it's much less calculations are there is no problem with the singularities because the singularities occur in joint space that's where the manipulated cannot move in a certain way because the physical structure is precluding it from doing so in joint space that's immediately let's calculations we only doing the inverse kinematics of this target points a problem we cannot follow a straight line right that's the simplest let's say we calculate the joint coordinates for the media in the initial poem and the target point forget about intermedia so we had that converting joint space with plan a path in joints but we have no idea where that have in actual condition space where the Robert is moving is a straight line or what it is what it is ok so we cannot force a particular trajectory very easy if that's not that is not a problem for us if we are ok if it is not exactly straight line but it proximate that's fine so we have less calculations but if we want follow-up particular trajectory doing it in joint space is very that's much easier to do in Cartesian space right we can actually track a share because we're putting the points that we want to go in the actual Cartesian space where the manipulator if give it a straight line to move on it will move on straight line so how do we do basically we plan in a Cartesian space using the Korda NN2 find the orientation of the Rob we can use any of the mechanisms that you learnt so far equivalent axis Euler angles in all this mechanisms to cook chips the corresponding angles for the joints you can use those for so we can track a shape here it is much more expensive at runtime biggest what happened I'm we have a initial point we have a gold point retract with planet trajectory how do we make sure that the Robert actually goes along Dr J basically at real time we have to sample points along that trajectory often enough to force that kind of Project and then compute for that all the giant coordinates and make sure that we feed That to the actual to go for that right so it's much more computationally intense to force that particular ok ent the other major problem is that we have a discontinued problem because if we are planning in Cartesian space we have our nice straight line that we are following incubation space we convert to joint space it might turn out that it is impossible to do that MOT some examples right now of so boast basis half-blood system minuses in reality usually use some sort of a hybrid of and to limit the competition but also to make sure that you're not Collide without any questions if you have before I forget so let's look in the planning this we have a rabbit we have a starting point we have a target point b it's a relatively simple onto link this is the reachable space of the manipulator when stretch both legs you're traversing the outside circle when you collapse one into the other you traversing the inside so the grey shaded area is the reachable space Rob so we have to points initial a gold point b the boat reachable for this money play they are in the original space now if we plan a straight line in Cartesian space you see that it goes through a space where you cannot reach this point see is not reachable so the intermediate point is not we will know that until we actually start doing this complications along the path and suddenly find out that we are running into a single array so that's one type of problem let's say they're all vegetable ok we have starting point a go point b everything along this along this path is Richard ok the singularity is right there in the middle well as we approached that singular position you're joining velocities go to infinity and obviously you won't be able to follow this straight back because of that again we wouldn't be able to know that in advance if we planning conditions until we actually reach that point so here is another example in which both points are reachable everything along the path is reachable without insulin you know the last days however the two solutions are actually different reachable into different joint space area so we cannot go from point a to point b in a continuous motion along that path because point is reachable from the left configuration if you want point B is reachable from the right configuration that they are not intersect ok so this is the type of problems that we can Encounter when we are planning in conditioned space on cell so far away can I have set up the problem and see what kind of difficulties they can be now let's put some formulas down on how do we actually plan will assume one generic variable you end so it's x you can be XYZ if you doing the conclusion coordinates it can be alpha beta gamma if you using Direction cosine hi it can be taytos Peter wanted to date a sex if you have a six degrees of freedom manipulator with joint angles so will use that generic variable to the note any of those including tyre lecture here will be using that you as the common variable you just think about it that when you do the actual plan you will substitute you 4 x 4 y 40 and then plan for all of those independent so ok we want to go from one point to another any space one variable what's the simplest way straight line right now I go from here to there along a straight line that's my simplest Project the problem with the state by needs that we have discontinuous velocity said the past point Nick as a straight line only gives you basically two parameters ent you're not in control of how fast you go or acceleration so here is an example you want to go from point a to point b Via point b's and C's so raise the initial point the is the target point and bncr intermediate point right so the simplest trajectories we go from a to b b to c c to the along Straight Lines Anna sui set we'll see it in the formulas in more detail but basically if we plan a straight line from A to B you know we can't guarantee that the straight line from B to c will have the same velocity at point as it was the end velocity of the previous cigna so it's going to be a discontinuous jerky motion if you're going if you're starting and stopping intermediate one and then you're starting from the intermediate then is stopping in the next intimate that's fine but usually those intermediate points or introduce their so that we don't collide with obstacles or we can achieve certain task in the mood then in necessary to stop at them in with probably don't want to stop them because they waste Ennis so we want a kind of go continuously from a 2D avoiding those obstacles on the side going as close as possible to be and that's usually the so what do we do we do Straight Lines with plants in those intermediate points cell restart you know usually again we we have time to accelerate on the Robert Rangers and just start from scratch so we have a small blend then we maintain a straight velocity for a while then we get a Quran bee to maintain the continuous velocity than a straight line then a curve straight and then we deceleration stop Grace so you can think if you want about this vehicle that we so it's planning a path so that's the next the next level planning and then of course another way to do it yes instead of using Straight Lines we can actually do a cubic polynomial solver obviously PowerPoint it almost looks like it stripline with blends but think of it as a cubic putting on your right so you're actually having an higher degree of freedom Curve between each other points along the path that will be slightly more complicated from a formula Sarah Barry following and then finally if you have a lot of constraints that you want to satisfy along the way are you might want to use a higher order polynomial like a queen takes or septic so whatever because in this case in the cubic polynomial we have to be following on here as well seen them and has 4 parameters so you limited on how many constraints UK satisfy say you're starting from certain position your ending a certain position you're starting with velocity 0 your ending with some velocity that's about if you want to control acceleration deceleration thinks that you need higher degree falling on you because you need more quiet satisfied that and we'll see that more but of course the higher degree polynomials the Farmers get more usually we try to get away The Sims ok so far and that again is the planning for each of the degrees of freedom each of the positions each of the angles for each of them you can do that kind of planning so let's look at the actual formulas it is a single cubic polynomial ogero equation for that would be of course that's in as a function of time would be a 0 + a 1 t + 88 + 82 size me said we have 4 parameters here which can we can use those parameters to satisfy certain conditions for the motion typically what will have is we'll have as initial conditions same starting point and some ending no thanks will be give in a where do we start the motion and what is the position for each of the intermediate points and the go point where we want so these two conditions so 8 x 0 you have zero issue 0 which basically immediately gives is the value for a sub Zero and then at time t f which is the duration of this particular interval are we have some values of and that will give us one equation app for the remaining free and notes A1 ok and then we can have more conditions for example for the velocity this is a graph of the velocity of that function now the velocity I heads on the A1 A2 and A3 that's just the river with respect to time and again as initial conditions let's say that we want to start at velocity zero started rest in finish at wilberlee not be finishing a press that the intermediate points this is the simplest case so you don't 800unit f is so that immediately gives us avado for a 1 which will be 0 if you don't 2:00 and then another equation for a 2 and a 3 so now we have two equations for a 2 and 8 one that will come from you daughter this about and one that will come from your PC set to Linear equations 2 and 9 that's the beauty about working with polynomials is that everything is linear right so we can find the solution an end as far as d acceleration the acceleration is concerned we are posted musical.ly it's fixed we can control that's whatever it is that it's it will come from the form so that's why I was saying that if you want to control the acceleration then you need a higher degree polynomial to give you more Quran the work so basically here is the solution I'm now going to spend the time from your rabbit's right now but it's pretty simple to any other questions with two and mum's 823 these are the values of A2 and A3 A1 reset to zero because the velocity of the Beginning is 0 ma0s u0p that's position time 0 so as you can see the trajectory depends on the initial position goal position n the time that we want to verse that says gradus now if we are using intermediate points then what we want to do is that at the intermediate points in the middle we don't want to stay so we don't want the velocity they're 20 sell for continuous motion with no stop we need velocitus at the intermediate point so time zero the velocity will be sun Valley you said $0 Anna time t will be somatic let's assume for a second that goes our giving will see you later deal with so those will be at for the initial condition will have the position in the beginning the position of the the velocity of the beginning the velocity at the end four conditions four parameters A0 A1 A2 A3 again linear equation yes acceleration is a constant if you differentiate the original equation I'm sorry and it's not answered away right so but it is fixed in terms of the value of the acceleration is fixed because we done it's a function of time but the parameter we cannot control we cannot it will be a fixed line SO2 right B16 3 x 10 I think I probably had it at a particular are you yeah no no no udot no that's the third right this is the this is the third derivative is 6/8 here this is the acceleration you double that right it's a straight line what I meant is the values A2 and A3 have already been computer using the conditions that we have before right because we had four conditions for a no weird computer so we really don't have a control over that so it every time it will be fixed we don't have extra conditions that allow us to control the accelerator so there is no control of the acceleration it's fixed innocence it comes out whatever it is going to be based on the other computer if we want to control the acceleration so have certain variables that we can introduce their then we need a higher degree polynomial you know to use for conditioner so I am sorry if I misspoke I didn't mean to to be fixed in terms of evolve I also show you the Currys obviously not text they cancel but the numbers that define that line art we cannot mechanicum based on go configurations like I cannot say I want the acceleration add points to Sub-Zero to be certain it will be basic 82 x 2 which will be determined from before so I have no control what is where's the slug in based on the conditions that were put in it doesn't need it doesn't have to it depends on what the number that's for that particular just start ok so and see where we were here so we have different initial conditions we have certain values in our obviously the formulas are going to be A608 still use of 0 because we start at from 0 we have this you Sub-Zero is the initial point ace of one now is going to be you Sub-Zero because that's the condition event 482 and a free we again have two equations with two unknowns and there will be function this time not only of the positions and the time but also of the target velocity ok so if we know the target positions used 0 you survive the target velocities use of 0 that you survived the target duration for that segment we can compute the trajectory given dose now I have to find us well obviously if we know the actual velocity and angular velocity for the Robber that we want to have for the actual coordinator and then we can use the inverse of the Jacobi define the new dots in the Kardashians so if we say ok we wonder each of the links of the manipulator to have certain velocity when you have an industrial Robert they are all target that for certain velocity since angular velocities that they're in the characteristic of the mechanical you put those in the condition she can calculate Taggart film another ways you can have the system choose some reasonable velocity using gymnastics for example if we have several if we have several links that we want to travel in the trajectory in addition of having continuous velocity maybe we want to have some averages on each site of the most so that you can have a blended continuous motion with the least amount of energy so you can put this kind of heuristics whatever is important for your type of motion that you're planning for have the system automatically compare devil and then find out that you can actually introduce additional constraint self example we have you one is the velocity for the first you and that is the velocity for the first segment u20 is the velocity for the second signal so we want to make sure that the Via point where the two segments we have continuous velocity so then you not one you want that at piece of Earth will be you 2.0 alright pickups the same lost we probably want the same acceleration as well so then here is the second derivative comes in you know as an additional condition and add that to the sis obviously if we do that then we have to take some other constraints out because we might have too many constraints if we have 4 for each of the 4 for each of the segments then we don't have we don't have enough to satisfy you and so these are the type that is the type of reasoning the type of reasoning that you can use to compare nose smells typically you will not be given them you just want to go from one point to the point that and some time frame in my the time might not be even given as well just might want to use the time by Christopher you're how fast they want to do as fast as we can do without x going over the speed motion link ok so this is so far this is cubix points interpolation any so we'll move to Linea now so linear interpolation straight line we have starting time 0 goaltime TV survive position of the Beginning use of 0 positioner Diane Tuesday Bath and that Aries there is no more there is no more conditions that we can satisfy in this case because we two parameters a Sub-Zero ace of 1 and we have two conditions and that uniquely defines our most that was problem is that if we take an acceleration here it will just be a sub one whatever is the value that comes in from those two conditions and we cannot control so we have now we going to introduce this parabolic plants that we were talking about so we have the pace of 0 is the starting time the Disappeared is the end time and then we have this plant and the plant the first plant occurs at time t should be the next plan is a time t-shirt f - December so by assuming that the length of each of the blinds are thus 4 simple my met card so in this case the the equation for the parabolic brand itself yes on usurp the is 1/2 80 Square so we have one parameter which is a we want to introduce some conditions for this parameter so that will give us one more condition that we can satisfy which in our case is velour you know we want to make sure that the velocity is continuous throughout the motion I'm so the velocity here a simply 8 x t and if we put a condition for constant acceleration for example then that will give that value a I'm all in that case basically will have usurped is 1/2 u double dot t-square where you download is the Excel and that acceleration will seen the moment how we can do that 4 continuous find sofa so another so if we want to have continuous velocity and then basically we can calculate the time for the blind from a condition for a continuous loss so we want this function usurped your Sub-Zero and you doubled up will give us the Valley for the blind for that particular region that achieves continuous the loss around and if you want to see the actual condition of the actual equation they're in the book they love it complicated but it's basically second degree of freedom polar where t here is the duration of the entire motion from disappear so we basically have here the equation for the motion abusing straight line with parabolic blades in a continuous fashion from time t 0 to time everything here on the right side is given and it's functions of things that the given this is 0 this use of 0 used to be anyway we'll see you doubled up the acceleration is not given right away but will see how to computer replay TV 2 letters 0 + it's TF - this it makes it I'm sorry that's decent we want to make sure that oh yeah you're right it should be interesting we want to make sure that the time of the blend is the same right which is this be so that should really be d-sub 0 + disability because you want the plant ok let me more can't resolve it right now but it makes the idea is that the brands have the same amount of ok I guess if I had a similar piece of 0 is 0 but it doesn't have to be so from that and I think that this phone mirrors these formulas are computed with that in mind let me just check ok will check on there any other questions I'm glad you guys are paying the best how to get so now if we have several segments thinks can never get the little bit more hairy let's say we have the positions of the different points that we want to go through we have the slope of the different linear plants at the different linear portion which will be is going to give us the velocity and then we have the time directions which are in this particular case itoje is a sete so I typical segment is from disobey to the subject and the duration of the entire segment will be dij and then the duration of the next segment is piece of DJK etc then we have the duration of the actual branch will be denoted SK4 each of the blend we have the slope and then the duration of the straight line segment will be denoted with Peace up J K which is the straight line between position Jay and position ok so these are the parameters that they are introducing here so then we have used to buy is the first plant then piece of ij is the straight line dissabte is the next plant headset for all of ok the slopes we already denoted with you i j k k l o m so what is given here what will come back to the pic actually let's go what is given is the position you supply usage a usurped usurp el-nozha the points that we want to go through initial that final point in the intermediate that's one of the things that is given then are the next thing is the desired time durations 4 thane tyre trajectory from one point to the other so this whole thing is the only thing that is given we're not going to the will calculate all the other we just want to have this blog like linear section with the blood for the entire portion for the next portion at sadowsky desired i j t Desire JK etc those of the things that are given the tea iced dijs etc well computers your desire call answer that's a dress that's very good so busy time duration nndr think that is given or can be computed is the magnitude of the acceleration so usually this is certain limit for the particular joint that we are using say you know it can go faster than that with faster acceleration and then that and that would be you number sodeaus here this is not the knowledge here of this because it's not a graphic term the magnitude of acceleration is given as so using those we want to compute the blind times so how long each of the plants are the straight segment type x the velocities the signed accelerations because here we just had the magnet of the acceleration but we don't know where the we are accelerating or decelerating and that will depend on the motion and that's basically it so those formulas are given in the and notes ababil also look and a brief I'm 1 note is that the system usually calculates or uses default values for the acceleration based on the particular Robert based on the mechanical structure in a how fast do you want to drive a in a what's the Workspace etc and also the system can calculate Desire time duration based on default velocities so here is the formulas are there will be different clearly for the first segment and the last segments than the intermediate ones because if you remember the picture that's the one ok you remember the picture with starting here with a full bladder in the n we are ending with a full blank so that we can sort of Accelerate and decelerate smoothly and then in the middle we have kind of plants for each of the sun so the formulas will be slightly I have put the diff but it's all computed based on the conditions that we had Sofia the First segment we're given we're giving you support usurped and then we given the magnitude of the acceleration of the system has computer that so then we can compute the actual acceleration based on the sign of the difference between the whether it's an accelerating or decelerating so once we can kill them and then we know the the duration of the entire heart another line that but the entire segment then we can compare he said one using that are then we can compute the velocity for that segment you do 12 and then we can compute the time for the linear parts of the of the that part then moving on today inside segment again we can find the velocities just simple in opposition of a time then we can find the science acceleration the same way as for the first one we can find the time for the linear plan by using the velocities that we found in the acceleration and then finally we can find the time for the straight line segment I just subtracting from the whole time for the segment times for the blind and as you see here the plants here have half on each side and then when we get to the end similar to the first one we find the actual acceleration the sound acceleration we find the time 4 the last plant we find the velocity and finally we find the time for the last Straight Lines it is I cannot look scary but it's very simple formulas very simple derivation basic Yale second-degree equations for the time's up there cinema Limerick so using those sets of formulas we can go from the beginning to the end and compare Project I don't know exactly what kind of how much you guys are getting but you might actually have to do that for for a project of so so fine yeah I am I'm coming to it right now in evening about not going through the point right Syria so what you actually see here is you're not going through the actual point right you're going around now remember that we introduce this via points the main reason really to have these via pointers when we're planning emotion phone Rob with obstacles we want to introduce this kind of intermediate points to make sure that we go around the obstacles say 3 not that important that we go through the exam points unless you know we want a force it then we'll see you right now that we can force it but in principle the Via point is just to make sure that we avoid certain spaces in the Workspace ok so it's not that important but if we do want to go through them then we have you know several mechanism are we can introduce studio fire pit so here is the original buyer point that we want to go to we can introduce on both sides you know on a small distance 20 and do the planning 4th and then the straight line will go through the fire point if we planet that Indian culture we can also double ok the other thing is we can use a sufficiently high acceleration to actually Force through a particular point or if we want to stop there we can sleep therapy the right ones and then we'll have you know I will make sure that we go flat that was obviously affect the formulas will I make sure that we don't have division by 0 Adare Manor the bottom line is that this via points are really there so that we have general motion around the space that is avoiding ok now this were the two mechanisms we can use cubic polynomials or straight lines with parabolic blends I'm as we said if we want to satisfy more conditions then we can use higher order polynomial for example I'm let's say we're given 2 positions two velocities into acceleration for that particular now we have 6 conditions right so you know we can use a Quinta we have 550lb in Romeo parameters dragon dos conditions there 6 equations 6 unknowns because some of them are relatively simple you Sub-Zero your sabath will be taking parameters down so it's not going to be.com if we use median ok the formulas are actually in the if you're really now another thing is we can use different functions by using polynomials because they result in a linear equation so it's really that simple to say I if you want to if you feel particularly challenged that particular day you know you can use exclamation functions trigonometric functions whatever you want to plan the Project oh Craig of the am I not being the notes you write yeah it's incorrect they're not in are there available and I think that 718 is actually I think you should worry too much I don't think you'll be getting there but you know ok so so far let's stop for a second I'm so far we basically look that different mechanisms 2plan pass given condition for the trick ok it's been virtue right is just in a map formulas of what you can do which is the underpinning that will be good to know now what do you do when you actually doing the planning for for the Roberts so runtime path generation so basically we need to feed something to the control system to tell the different joints no positions will our cities etc for the different joints of the Robert Wright Soto hair stands for in auto wanted to take the 336 depending on you know whether it's a six degrees of freedom rival joints or free prismatic free revolut whichever you know it's a generic generic and those are the actual values that we fit to the to the Robert so what do we do the part generator computes the path at some update time at some update so we saw the Beginning point intermediate points we can compute all those values using the formulas that whistle if we are planning in joint space directly let's say we using cubic spline we can change the set of the coefficients at the end of each segment and feed That to the control system so we start with certain set of coefficients be fitted to control them the rabbit is moving when we approached the allo and say ok x you know ft those numbers a time that he does numbers etc and we get that give explained if we using linear with a parabolic plant then we have to check each update whether we're in the linear portion or in the branch portion because we have different formulas for the different and depending on where we are weak feet virus we're staying here updates basically you know at certain frequency you know that you are updating the control sis you can give the points in your feet them right the following so the cubic splines we have those particular update at the linear with parabolic we have to figure out which part of the formula as we are it's not a big deal we have the formulas it's simple the problem is that we're not following a particular trajectory we're just moving can I have continuously in the space if we doing the planning in Cartesian space and then we calculate the conditions position and orientation at each update pint using this same formula and then we have to calculate the joint space quantum using Ida inventory Cavan and the riveter War RDA find the equivalent primary presentation and then use the inverse kinematics functions do data.in payday and you should know how to do that now so this is how we can compute although on top of that you have to remember that this is typically what we saw so far is just for one parameter so we have to be careful to make sure that the motion is continuous if we're planning for all three of the parameters that the times are the same so things get more complicated when you're trying to build a full Sister at the end of the line the underlying and so that's that's so much about the trajectory planning and different in a parameter and how we do that competition now if you have any question will we can talk a little bit about Ansell if we have and there is a whole course on you know motion planning who's the worst thing is that he's still doing that it's a very very cool that's that's yes I did so it's a lot of so in in that case basically there are several considerations that we need to keep him we let say we have a 6 degrees of freedom I'm so the question then is the upan of you pass at your plan apart for the home and you later when you're doing that are you dealing with the global motion in the space or the loco-motion we're just the end affect the race so typically you do some sort of a combination between a global and a local motion plan using global motion planning when you're moving from a relatively empty space and you know you know you're not going to be here you know heating off the coast and then when you get the place where it's more product with obstacles then you switch to a locker more precise motion planning for the end effector own I'm so that's one type of that's one type of plant another one is configuration space approach and I'll show you feel slides on that infect with switch ok so let's say we have up we have an environment with obstacles key ok and we have point Roberts a small circular point that we want to move around this ok in that Robert actually has certain the circle has a radius of gates it has so what we can do is we can plan in configuration space a basically we take the obstacle and we grow them we're the size of the point Roberts tissue ok I'm in which case if you look at the Red Dot there the idea is that if we plan a path for the Red Dot that doesn't care with this grown-up stickers then we know for sure that the circle the circle is not going to collide with the smaller target tops and so then we just have a planning for path1 in that space which can be done many this grown-up sticker are cold c space configuration space obstacles in this is a AC space planning approach at what we can do this we can put the great around it and then plan the path for the point around this great so that it doesn't collide with the grown-up circle and then when we get back to the circular orbit here it's not going to come with the obstacles itself if we have a several degrees of freedom Robert we start adding orientation then this configuration space obstacles can be not on the planner which is here but then you get the free dimensional obstacle because you were thinking about the orientation that you're approaching or you can many dimensional obstacles if you have many degrees are free so in it's more generic form that becomes planning for a n dimensional half in mm base then
