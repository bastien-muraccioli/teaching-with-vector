ok let's get started so before I get into logic next week saving break there's no more and after you guys on the Monday I'm in the finally the day after pretty much I want to take a few me this is a platform that are we friends of Albion Market how people and everything as well one is that you will get a Arbor credit I'm using polar watch it and also provides additional I want to give a quick demo if you go over 2 you can register for an account I'm going to demo Kevin you were in a place that you actually get to see on a website just because that's what's going to be rolled out soon I'm so let's create a worksheet in demo worksheet is like a Jupiter notebook if you're familiar with that and you can do things like radar right I am going to Ryan's classification I'm so let's suppose the tidal sy21 final ok and then you can upload code or data so I'm going to go ahead and upload the sentiment dataset hopefully this Sounds Familiar to some of you and then I'm also can upload this text class apy Tesco so each of these are resources data or code is called a bundle and cuddle and you can look at the contents of this one that you can download it I'm having unique ID which specifies forever the precise version of this Imelda the interesting thing you can do weather now as you can rhyme come it's pretty like we can run basically and you can me and you I'm you specify the dependencies I'm Dad the scamander need to rely on and then you can type in whatever text Claire wire tree Palermo train test India you can also see other here you can specify how much resources you want when you want you need to access the network I'm in so this goes and create a docker image that actually running O'Doherty know that actually running this command and you I visualise the standard output in a real time the command is running and you can see the files out of January so for example one of these files is just a json file their house the test so suppose you wanted to visualise the experiments of about because this is kind of just a default information house big the barn owls and you can go this is a little bit more events but I want a theory how this works you can define custom and if you define a schema which is I can't run you add Justin Fields you can actually specify test error is a custom field and you say go to start address on readout and then how you use that table to desk minus table you can see this is the test Mrs a word of a nice 3 decimal place ok and then you can go and you can modify this command and it's a rear and maybe I wanted to try some other parameter are there and the step size try some more you can be around us to and so Avon chef job you can come on them so this one's running this one's created and you can monitor and a very generator good weight what jobs in Canada no forget about it skip track Holly so then you can say largest app sizes are so the idea behind her work she like in Jupiter is that you document your experiment as you go along an so every asset data code and bundle are the experiment all kind of treated the same way so that you can go and here and six months later and you know exactly what come on you round to get this result and exact dependencies so there's so you think about this is kind of agate for I'm if you go to the main side or you can actually fire some charged with using them depending on how many people using and mitoq on mine on so if you have WhatsApp good way to go how much memory can you typically get so there's the one thing that if you want to find out I saw it varies depending on what kind of races are available but if you type any sort of come on free you can actually see those exact environment that your job is wrong I'm so Nikon you can jazz B maybe you'll say 1016 any other questions about so there is documentation here and if there's any issues that you write into a file get request or email me or something 1 have the highest of you can put something else out to you but will be probably faster of you similar github does this work only with Python you can run any command Java is it yeah you can so the thing when you do a run you specify the doctor in which is basically contained Julia probably has images of Phillip and we have a default one that has on I don't I'm not sure if you worry about it but house canvas stand yeah so if you want install some dependencies there's two things you can do you can build your own docker image take a load of work when it's not too hot or you can if you want to be lazy you can just do Pip install here in the command and you for that you have to make sure you turn on our cats yeah you can have does this support pop-up Windows now this is more like a bat so the way there there are several ways you can do this there is a you can actually expose on like a port so you can connect your views intensive borders and connect to your job on the floor or you can actually there's a way to mount the contents of the bonnet whilst trying to local disk hold off further questions please contact me afterwards just wanted to make that play that thing is available go check it out ok so back to the top that we've I'm disgusting so on last Wednesday when produced logic remember this three ingredients of a logic there is a syntax which defines a set of valid formulas resembling propositional logic it's rain and white is a particular form so send these formulas order arm symbols they have no intrinsic meaning to themselves the way us the fine Amin is semantics so we talked about interpretation function which takes a formula a model which represents save the world and Returns are either true or false the way to think more generally about a formula is that cars outer set of models which are configurations of world where the formula is true in this case the four possible models hair rain and wet corresponds to this set of models which are I'm right here where it's raining out what finally we talked about inference rule where if you have a knowledge base which is a set of formulas what new phones as can be the ones important thing to remember is that these formulas are not meant to replace the knowledge-based these are things which are derived which could be very simple thing as you might you have a lot of knowledge about the world but you might want on a given context I know that it's real which is so Alfie is much much smaller I'm done the knowledge base in terms of complex so for raining what you can drive round also in general we run in France what is the mean to do large going friends you have a knowledge base and then you have a set of Interest rules that you keep on turning and turning and then you'll see if you produce w sorry I'm soap an example we saw last time was more disponor which cells if you have weird and weekday and wedding weekend traffic and you can drive traffic so the things on the top or god promises and the things on the bottom or cold is the conclusion and more generally you have this and what is ponies in French so now the question is what does this inference what have to do with semantics because this is just symbol minutes you just study symbols introduce another injured ankle the since mattocks we talked about arm soundness and completeness so entitlement is a property between relationship between knowledge base and of Formula which is given by the Marlowes right so the models of f have to be a superstar on models of khabib that's a definition and tell me separately we have an ocean division symbol minutes you can drive after giving a set of inference rules from kids and on sound this means that the set of formulas that you derive are always until incompleteness means that you can derive all detailed remember there's a water glass analogy set of things in the glass or our true Intent formulas and you want to stay within a glass for Euro 1 so sofa with lookout propositional logic which is any legal combination of symbols properties and symbols and their connected we also look at a subset of r called propositional logic with horn clauses we're all the formulas look like this you have other bunch of property no symbols in ply some other propositions and so there's a trade-off here so we saw that property no logic is not if you use modus ponens in proposition you're going to be sound when You're Rocking there are certain types of formulas would you want the other device I'm so we could either restrict a positive logic to only one clauses and we show last time that this indeed is complete or weekend say we really want propositional logic the folks persipan and since that we're going to do this King call resolution watch we're going to talk about in this song cancel this like she has two parts were going to talk about resolution for propositional logic and then move on to first is there a tie asking about this love cement or I'm sorry it is the question as anything I can do at the last moment I can do with her previous s the last one depends I mean by so these are different a statement about expressive power in infants propositional logic subsumed propositional logic only one chords so you could just say I only care about passing on but it's turned up this is going to be expensive time in the system so what is the completeness I'm using a very precise way to talk about are of completeness of a logical system I said of inference rules means that anything that is until buy the semantics of propositional logic is derivable via assertive any particular side of rose here is Modus ponens R4 this case and the resolution so the complaint is really a property of resolution of the inference rule with respect to r any other question ok so what time into resolution so what's mean busy phone call try to draw them a lot of to do that we're gonna take this example from class am plycie and we're going to ride it with the strong For Reasons I'll become clear I'm going to write some of these identities on the board so these are things which are hopefully you Uno on last time this is just true I want to send definition what's the definition because the definition is the interpretation function but you can check the 2 by 2 truth table and this lovely pmq religious is the same as Same either PS4s or curious a PS4 stand account hypothesis for so it's irrelevant yqs and if Q is true then Benassi so what I am and be in plycie so I can write it as not a or not b or c so this involves another identity so which is that if I have not of p and q that's the same as not p or not Esso and there's also another version which is p rq is a same as P Nike ad so what I'm doing intuitively is pushing this location pasta the connectives into the property no SIM and when I push It Pass an occasion pass and flip to another and when I push your pass Andorra flips and hopefully you guys to be comfortable with this because when you're doing programming and you're running if same are you that's a good question so though what is the order of operations it security a and b implies ok so if you apply the second I'd energy on the board here you have a MB is not a or not be and then you applied of the first identity and that thing RC ok so now I'm going to introduce some terminology first use of literal so this is going to be either a proposition or simple or it's occasion and there's a notion of a Klaus which is just you're disjunction of little also destruction means or so these things are all clauses and finally there is I'm a particular type of clothes Cardiff 1qu how much I introduced last time define Anakin the different light-year which is clauses that have at most one positive l Esso these classes there is indeed only one are positive l also Deezer Hong Kong class and remember from last time if you have snow or traffic I'll carry on the right hand side then that has two positive are liberals witches which means in Stata I'm right modus ponens the following so A&E implies c which can be written is a disjunction I'm allows me to derive c and here is another intuition which is that I'm kind of effectively cancel my not and I'm taking the so the resulting things and putting on the boat alright so now let's introduce the resolution roll so general clauses could have any number of Lidl's so this is not a one class but it is a class and the resolution rule for a particular this particular example looks like this so rain or snow not so or traffic allows you to derive rain or track so this is not ape SoundCloud right because I have two positive literals and how do we intuitively understand what's going on so you can say ok snowing snow in place traffic which means I was it was it snowing that I can get traffic there is that's the way I still have rain here so I I can conclude 8-seater renew in general the resolution rule looks like this so you have a quad up here some p obvious how many have a second clause with not and what you can do as you can cancel a P&O p and then you can take everything else and then Pokémon as a big hug close so this is a row kind of schedule they argue that it's a reasonable thing to do arm but really formally verify that you have to check the sound and we do soundness remember how do you check soundness you go back to the semantics of propositional logic and you verified that consistent with what resolutions trying to do so in this role you have rain or snow the set of models a rain or snow is everything that's not white here on the set of morals I'm not snort RAF is everything that's not white over here and when you intersect them UK after dark red and that that represents your I'm where you think the save the world is if you only have the the premises amen if you look at the models of the conclusion Renault Trafic it's a screen area and you just have to check that what you derived is a superset of Ryu now this might be a little bit counterintuitive by you should think about knowledge as restriction knowledge means that you actually have pinpointed the save the world to be smallest newer colour boxes you have the more knowledge you crepes all the sound completeness is another much harder thing to check top most reptiles are this is a autowire these there this is so this this Square is only true in rain or snow and this is only true in not knowing but remember the the way to think about an ultricies that matters is the intersection of all the four models of all the form someone have intercepted the models of everything up here I'm only left with the dark 1 squared it's not there's Brothers 2DS turn wondering when you're ready so let Siri why are the ones up here not included because they're not part of the internet is your question why are these squares knob part intersex so they're not let me clarify if you only look at the prophecies appear the set of morals is the square the Square Leicester Square London then you look at the premises or sorry the conclusion in look at the model in a penalty can you get the sex yeah so this is the green is just the right from there the Green alright so it's that resolution is also complete and this is New York the Big results from the 60s Dad demonstrate that even I can have a single raw can draw of propositional logic vol clearly things that this resolution Road doesn't work on because only wasn't clauses so whatever what is our formulas that aren't closed at all so there's a cannabis there were who is that were going to reduce all formulas to quads so another definition of this important here is cnf so sense for conjunctive normal form so Sienna formula is just a conjunction of clauses so here is an example of seeing a formula here's a close here's a choir then you can join born to remember that so just a refresh this is a cnf formula is a conjunction of clauses each class is a disjunction of Lidl any slither.io is either a property in Simple Words so or is on inside and is older out waid Academy make sure you remember that a knowledge base remember is a set of formulas for really represents the conjunction of all those formula because you know all the facts in your and I so you can think about off seeing a funny that is just knows where each formula ok so we can actually take any formula in propositional logic and we can convert it into a quiver Sarah formula would a show in the neck and what we've done that then resolution mainline Sol the conversion is going to be just 6 step procedure arm Lando is a little bit crunchy but but I just want to have a highlighter the general interest so we have this formula so this is not a sin a formula but we're gonna make it ok so the first thing we want to do is run and remove all the symbols that Amanda ordinate because no definitely don't show up unforeseen so we can use the identity the first identify the board to convert implication into I'm not in or I'm you do that for the inner of guy here and now you only have symbols that yours the second thing is I remember the order in which these connectives is important for seeing a so annotation is on the variance application is only allowed to touch no problem then you have or destruction on and then you have it unwanted change the order so that that is so first win wonder christening mediation all the way inside and this is using the Morgan's last of the 1st of the 2nd and 3rd and he's on the phone and so we push this inside so that now all the medication is on the on the inside we can remove double negation check that valour I'm in finally so this is not us say that for me my look like when it's not if you turn your head upside down it actually looks formula but the reason is that and is on inside but it should be on outside in to fix that you can actually distribute or over and which allows you do say this is summer or bizarre bizarre and not snow or Bazaar so now this is this is a general set of Rules just a recap you eliminated by Direction implication implications to get the symbol image rewrite and then you move location all the way to inside on any Neil experience navigation they don't need and then you move any or from outside to inside the the date so lottery store take any propositional logical formula you can make enough so that was a generally we're just going to assume we have seen another place that you might have seen sumif formula come up as when you're talking about computer science we're talking about 3 massages problem what you give enough Cena formula whatever class has three symbols and three little holes in your trainers cyber Arbroath ok so so now let's talk about the resolution ever remember there is a relationship between Intel 9 and contradict so most recent health is the same as a nose is incompatible with like really really matter it is impossible that not out so suppose we wanted to prove that I'm half is derived the knowledge base are we going to do with this proof by contradiction strategy where we're going to say insert not after into a knowledge base see if we can derive a country so you add not having to convert all the formulas into cnf and then you keep on replying that resolution rules and you are return in town yes you can derive false ok so here's an example for this looks like so here is another space here is a political formula in want to know whether Katie entails ok so you add it add not into North Face so that's not see and I'm going to convert this into a cnf so that only affects the first one we are here and then I'm going to be poorly applied so I can take this are claws resolution allows me to cancel naughty with and then I take beer not be cancelled out Alnwick Castle when ucca not oh that's clear contradiction you can drive false which means that the knowledge base in Turtles f there's also maybe gives a lumbar into ocean of the mysteries of defining a goal clause in Hong Kong driving you're probably implies false because you can add on something that you trying to prove you can use modus ponens to see if you can drive false and if you do the rifles send it say alright so as I lived it before there's a time complexity difference between Vodafone internet sofa MotoSport each row application as only add a clause with one propositional symbol imagine having problems with symbols you can really only apply Motorsports and so that's my new number about where is the sing with resolution is that you can add each row application can add a clause with many propositional Simba worst case you can imagine any subset of the propositional symbols this results in the X-Men full-time it should not be surprising because we know that i3status so unless there is some magic here there's no way so questions why is resolution preferred so you could just everything to see nothing check do backtracking resolution transito have generalizations to first-order Logic model checking so it's all remember there's two ways you can go about you I'm do basically reducing the csps and then you can solve or you can try using so this inference rule doesn't reduce resolution in propositional logic by the 1st you can't have no when you see the world the question is whether the two are resolution looks like kind of like in there I'm quite big difference star maybe we could talk about ok so summarise there's two right here you can say are you going to use professional article 21 classes and be using Modus ponens this is fast but it's not Express or I can Embrace the full complexity of a problem logic AND use resolution and this is exponential time it's low but it's more what I mean by expressive I mean the latter which is that there simply some things you can write down whiskers you can write down and rainforest any sort of branching or destruction you can do it so in some applications one class action turns out to be so these type of horn clauses show up in programming languages where are you you see some promises and you tried and arrived some other qualities so I can program news for inefficient ok so what's the most the first oral so what's wrong with prophecy the exponential time so hello better be pretty good so remember the point of logic is to in general my perspective is to be able to represent and reason with knowledge in it so there's a lot of things that I'm we want to represent but might be awkward improv so here Alison don't know how would you do this well personalised stickers about propositions so this has to proposition I'm which are statements which are you the true or false Alice knows arithmetic and Bob the weather Alston in snow how is your rap well you probably do something like this where are you houses to rent in Alvaston because all process all I can do is the weather this is good box every even integer greater than 2 is a sum of 2 so good luck with that you might have to write down all day so propositional logic is Quantico best not expressive in words what's missing I'm when we have knowledge in a in the world is often more natural to think about the is being object and predicates on these objects rather than just opaque proposition so Alice nose arithmetic actually has more internal structure it's not Justice single proposition that has nothing to do with anything else it has no chance of Alison nose in if I only once you can decompose a proposition into pa you can do 30 things with you can use qualifiers and variable bring up always a quantifier that applies to each person you want to do that inference Without You overall for all the ok so I'm going to talk about first-order logic going through are plan of first talking medicine Dennis man and then so I want to warm up with just some examples I'm not going to do as rigorous of the treatment of thrush oral Ahmed more complicated and I just want to give you an idea of so I was in Baden-Baden this is going to be represented as knows Alice river and knows Barbara so this is a there sulphur Morrisons I can and now the property of the propositional symbols have been replaced with this more structure and all students are in arithmetic get map to this were now have a qualifier for relax pseudonym implies nose x ok so I'll be more formerly so there is a bunch of definitions I'm gonna first order logic so I'm in first-order logic this to types of things there's terms and then there is Formula in propositional logic a Roman sauternes expressions that refer to objects so it could be a constant symbol it could be a variable yorokobi are functions applied to some other arithmetic is there Tinkerbell as a name there are variables like x which I explain later and this function of x 3 + x 40 represent some of remember these are just symbols and our formulas prefer the truth are you so there's atomic formula atom so this atomic formula is a predicate apply to turn so nose Exeter term arithmetic is a term therefore this is a Predator nose x arithmetic is anatomic so Adams are supposed to be indivisible bi-curious substructure hero so maybe you can think about Jesus there is a connectives as before so what we're doing right now is you're taking these atomic formulas Adams knee behaved wife propositional symbols so giving his Adams r sterilization to produce symbols we can stream them together using any number of as we've done a property in a final we have quantifiers applied to formulas which means that if you have a formula with a variable in it we can seek a qualifier over the variable specified how the variable is meant to be in piss off connectives and qualified alright so so let's talk about coronavirus quantifiers are in some sense the the heart of wife essaouira logic under 2000 qualifiers and universal quantifier and universal quantifiers YouTube think about is just glorified conjunction so when I have bro XP effects that's really like saying for Juve a b&fc for older existential quantifiers I qualify dysfunction when I say there exists Exeter pfx holds as a of A or B of the Earth Union Little Baby cuz I'm only I'm still talking about the syntax of her a logic but I can't resist will give you a little bit of information about what formula to find it them interpretation function hearing I'm just trying to give you an idea of Simba Cork so here's properties so if I push an occasion through on Universal quantification the narco zone inside farabi comes in exists does this sound familiar to people what it what is the name just a Morgan about a fight first an really important remember that the order of quantifiers matter exist is very different from exist ok so one more comment about quantifier it will be useful to be able to convert natural language sentences into your first oral Simon you're going to do about this but so this is others important to the things I want so natural language you Park Avenue quantifiers in actual words like every year song or are answer how do these represented LR formal logic everyone knows arithmetic every generally refers to so you might write something like this what is wrong so what's wrong about this sorry yes so the problem is that what is this say this is says everyone's a student for all x-axis and relax ignore the river so is basically saying everyone's as soon and everyone else so really really should be is implication anyone that's not a student child care in terms of this assassin validity of this formula and olive someone's assuming then I'm going to check whether that's doing those are guess what about existential quantification Samuels Sur nos arithmetic this is student hacks and knows x so knows a different connectives in a general rule of thumb is that whenever you have universal qualification it should be implication and whenever you have exercised your qualification it should be on Naas so of course there is exception but this is the church ok so let me give you a few examples just to get you used to think about so imagine you want to say there is some course and everything has taken so what how is that so if there is there is some Corsa that should be exist I'm wiser course that every soon as every is it for all acts and I'm 2 hours student employed text remember I exist has usually has an anthro has ok what about call back Arena Jersey interior sum of two primes this is every even integers every even integer greater than 2 implies that what about the what is the sum of two primes and no said there no maybe explicit Hansa you need a use existential the fact that these two primes are under stuff I mean Dad I'm literally exist so there is sync such a bottle my Prime and the sum of XY and Z is finally here is the same as ever student takes a course in a course covers a concept then the student knows that whether that's true or not is a different matter but this is of valid for me and it can be represented as follows someone other than your piece of advice is that if you see what if they generally suggest that there is a bunch of universal quad because if it's kind of like saying there's a general raw and universal qualifications back in general so this is for all X or Y or Z I'm you have a student and take some course and that course covers Arms cancel Z then that's a Raynaud's attack I'm get technically there should be also and concepts any questions about a first-order logic what is syntaxis in any of these into the question is why don't we just use the equals so I'm being lit about I guess cautious you're following a strict syntax where you have function they just take out gives you the the structure of logical expression stone cases UK you syntactic sugar and you can write but remember the point of logic is not to be able to write these things down manual the reason with bad to have a very kind of privet rebel assist are formulas that you have general rules are crazy ok so let's talk about this matter first Noel logic so propositional logic a model with something that maths proposition symbols to truth is another words as a complete assignment of truth I use to produce so what is this in first or large still we're going to maintain though intuition atom models supposed to represent a possible situation in the world so I'm going to give you a time for some go into so many we have Una in by napredak so these are predicate that only take 1 or 2 hours then we can think about a model as being representative so imagine you have 3 notes these represent two objects in the world so object can a first-class citizen first order logic and these are labelled with caution symbol sorry I'm a robber and you have arithmetic year and then the directed edges are going to represent binary or credit cards arm and these are going to be labelled With A predicate symbols I'm so here I have I knows predicate that applies 20103 another nose predicate apply 20203 are you not a predicate here ameriprise the Moore Family Amano inversa alagic is a mapping that takes any every cousin symbol to Andaz so I was go to A1 barbers 0203 an amaps predicate symbols 2 two bottles of vodka so nose is a set of pairs so sad the first element of pair knows the second I'm skipping function symbol system simplicity by you would define them crystal that is a model it's another more complicated problem because you have define something for Bow I'm the Tour of the the console symbols on the product to make our lives a little bit easier I'm going to introduce a restriction on as motor Vodafone examples so if I say John and Barbara students then in your hand in mine imagine while they're super Ball Dragon Ball xenoverse 2 there could be technically morning 1% who's name both John and Bob or someone who is anonymous and does it have Anderson two simplifications are roller MW2 MW3 so unique names can assumption says that object has most each object has an most one constant symbol the main closure says that each symbol has at least one concept so the point of this restriction princess constant symbols and objects I'm in one and once you do that then we can do something called propositional state in this case of floral logic is actually just us synthetic sugar for a problem I'm so if you had this knowledge base in first-order Logic 2 hours in Barcelona I'm for all people and their some creative studio then you can actually convert very simple way into propositional logic by kind of on roll it's icon rolling your Samsung so we just apps to analyse employees personality student bargain-priced person born in because of finance constant symbol is ibik Infinite sete the might be a lot of formulas but it's not going to be an MP so the point of doing this is now you can use any inference algorithm for propositional logic for first if you're willing to make this are restriction uniforms in Des Moines closure that means you kind of have direct access to all the objects in in the world by VR constant symbol in which case are you you're just proper you just have promises why might you want to do this I'm so first oral logic is is a syntactic sugar still might be convenient you might still want to write down are you expressions in versara Logic I'm in how the benefits of actually having Prodigy logic where the inferences in some sense match develop but later will see that there are some cases where are you you won't be able ok so that's all I'm going to say about semantics of free logic talk about inference ok so I'm going to start by talking about first or illogical 1 clauses I'm working I use some generalisation Motors and then working I move to 414 Anne Parker Bowles I'm generalisation of res ok so Let's Begin by defining definite clauses for festival remember definite clause in propositional logic was conjunction of Providence involved in plies some other properties symbol and now the propositional symbols are now this Adams as tonic formalize furthermore we have might have variables so we're going to have quite universal coronavirus internal you should think about this is a single template that gets real if you want a property realise you will be a horse of definite formulas in propositional so another way to think about this is that this single stamen is a very compact way of writing down what would be very cumbersome our promise Is Your Life instead ok so here's the formal definition so definitely Klaus has a point form you star by Oasis set of variables which are universally quantified and then you have atomic formulas which are all conjoined implies another atomic formula Andy's atomic formula contain any of these LSD Motorsports so here is a straightforward generalization of modus ponens you have some atomic formula e that you pick up and then you have a 12-pack employers be and then you use that ok so it says the first attempt so you might my cat on the fact that this actually won't work so why doesn't it work so imagine you have a few vallas and then you have for all x p of x and pies qfx so the problem is that you can actually in for a queue of Alice hello because p of Acts here play of Alice just don't this is possibly a one this was the A1 a xmp eval are not the same does an important lesson because remember this inference Rose don't know anything they have no intrinsic matter just imagine right your patterns right then it's just not going we can fix this solution to ideas substitution and unification so substitution is taking a formula applying a vinery place it's a genuine heart so if I want to replace x x I give you Alice I can do for 2 final replaces xyz and I'm going to replace x with Alison Ry answer and general substitution cedar yes some nothing from variable to terms substitution Returns the result of just performing a substitution on the chariots another formula with these variables replaced with free somebody ok unification text to formulas twice American the same an ultimatum thing you have to do some substitution so every turns what substitution example nose Alice arithmetic nose x this expressions or not st. actually identical but if I replace x with Alice heavy Rider that's what does this example how do I make these two identical I replace x with Alice air yyz what is 1 I can do anything because I can I can only remember some solution away to replace variables without the things I can replace constant symbols so can replace hours Elijah and then things can get a little more complicated when you have functional symbol so here to make you the same I need a replace x with Alice and then why would have expect has already been replaced so I need to make this why goes to Aberfan Chris summary summarises unification takes to formulas f&u and Returns A substitution which map variable two terms I'm in this is the most general uniform which means that if I unify accent I could also replace x with Alice no that's not the most I want to substitute as a little as possible make two things aren't equal so unify Returns A substance such that using contribute if I apply that substitution I get identically the same expression as a via play Theatre and if I can do it then I just fail ok so now yeah Equifax so the question is fsfx is this a variable or a formula so FX f is a function symbol so it stays are term and Returns a 10 set a timer timer factors of term which represents an object in the you can check that nose is a is a predicate so I need to take our terms ok so now with substitution unification and we can now revised or Motorsports to make it work so I'm going to have a 1 Prime k Prime which are distinct syntactically from I want to ok what I'm going to do is try to unify the primes in an Uprising inches and substitution in once I have the substitution I can apply this to be I'm going to arrive P Prime in that one I've tried ok so let me do go through this so suppose Alice is taking two 21 and 221 covers and rupees in this general rule that says if someone has a course and a course covers topics then that's so I'm needing unified this text Alice 221 covers to run my PC with this abstract version and where are you reply I get the substitution to be axed ok need to review replacement allons-y with 221 and he with MVP and then I can derive and then I take this Theatre and I apply that substitution to nose XZ and I get nose Alice so intuitively you can think about a 1 Prime Minister prime these are a concrete this is concrete you have a world this is a general raw so what a substitution does is a specified how the general variable arch to be grounded in their concrete things that you're dealing with and now the spinal substitution grounded out Roses part into the concrete symbol Tesco's Alice 221 what's the complexity of this I'm so each application Motors ponens produces an atomic formula just one done another one so that's good if you have any functions symbols the number of the tunnocks formula is most the numbers constant symbols to the maximum product everyday if you have like 100 possible values of x other possible those wire 100 possible dose of the number of possible formulas are you might produces 100 so that that could amount you can imagine this be I'm a very very large number so it's early but if earlier your light a to then yeah this is not so that's that's a good news the bad news from a complexity point of view if there are functions symbols then actually arm not just exponential time is Infinite Infinite because number possible formulas that you can produce is are Camembert and when were you have something like this well if you remember one of the functions could be song so you could have like someone and some of wine and some of wine you can in central encoder rhythmic the SA versa alarm ok so so here's what we know some modus ponens is complete 44 sorulari with only one class so what is completeness mean it means that anything that actually true that entail there exist a derivation a way of applying Mottisfont is to get there but the bad news is that it's semi decidable this means so first oral logic even when you restricted to one cos it's my decided this means what if f is in until forward inference using add complete inference rules in this case I'm not responding well eventually prove or the right in finite because it's completely make sure you're get it but if if it's not until we don't know we don't know when to start because I could go just keep on going on and on and actually no I show this in fire what is the complexity of a result that says it's not just explosion if you're familiar with the halting problem very ok so that's a bummer no it's not the end of the world because you can still actual I just rung of inference and get a part of result so you might succeed in which you know for sure because it sounds it's our is the Asus Intel and after a while well you just run out of six you time and you stop then you say I know ok St Helens Park about Reservoir so if I finished him off first or Elijah where are restricted to horn clauses my starter motor sport is complete does a small ring called that you can actually computer everything are you hope and now we're going to go to resolution so remember the first order logic includes one or more closet so here's an example so this is all serious now something and the fact that this is it exist here remember existential quantification is like Wi-Fi the junction so this is like our example of no snow or traffic so what are we doing this so we're going to follow the same strategy as what we do for propositional logic and everything to say and then we're going up really apply the resolute and the main thing that's going to be different is now we have the handle variables and qualifier anduze substitution but the structure is going to be there so the conversion to say enough is a bit Messi and Growth slowing down in Tours I just want to presented to you no what a look I'm so here is a zappos Mallow cinema for me what is this a the practice for all x so if anyone who loves or animals Is Love by summer what we want to produce is the final output is this Sienna formula gam cnf means conjunction of this junks east restaurant is atomic formula or atomic formula that here we see some functions that have emerged Skyline functions which arm explain later that's that's basically it so we have to handle variables and we're going to have to handle on somehow in the way we do this is a wee there's no qualifiers show up here buddyfight Everything's Gonna Be universally quantified which means that the existential quantifiers have to go away and Alexis Churchill coronavirus get converted into the funk alright so poem so there's a sick or a carrier number 68 set procedure we start with the same pride what are the first thing I want to do what remove all the symbols that don't shouldn't show guitar simple inventory career so we eliminate implication this is the same as Wilberforce oh here is this thing in plies at this thing replace h not that the first thing or not the second thing so now the expressions are more it's really the same aurora that way identity that we were involved in before it would do that for the inner expression we pushed the negation in words so without touching the atomic formulas Armin eliminated delegation so this is all news and something new hero is working to standardise the variable so this time is takeaway 9s by centralising variables I just me that this why this is why I actually different it's like having two local variables nothing because we're going to remove qualification later I'm just going to make them separate so this why it's replaced with ok so now I have this I'm going to replace existential quantifier variables with colon funk ok so this requires a little bit of explanation so I have exam the loves the ivax this existential is on the inside I'm here so of this universal corner fire song in Waze it depends on Prairie ximer have a difference so they captured is the panacea Counter-Strike I'm exists what I'm going to do is I'm going to are cashews tenancy by turning into a funk and the same thing happens over here I have exist why and I replace this locus why with us big white that depends on the variables American university qualified outside so unloved by animals is on in the I guess the first part so everyone who likes our animals Is Love by somewhere so this is the someone I'm because here I pushed in again navigation pasta for all it becomes ok so now I can distribute or overend to change the order of the are these connectives so that because it's you enough I want a conjunction of this drugs not at the junction of contacts finally I just disorder universal quantifier ok so I don't expect you to follow all that are in complete detail but this is just give me a basic idea ok so now ready to state the resolution rule l look very familiar to same resolution Rose before but now all these things are not probably symbols but atomic formula and now this is not pee that ABBA piano q and I because these in general might be different and I need to unify the I'm in then I'll take the substitution return my application apply it on the result the same way we did for Moses so here is an example of this I have animal or loves in over here not loves or feed and what I do I tried to unify this lies with this not lives I get this substitution so you have to replace with the effects and V with my ex it allows me to cancel these now now I've made my call I'm in I take the remaining and I apply the substitution so there's feeds you RV becomes fee Azealia Banks so nearest a morning to wish I can provide by this does become a little bit of Strat and you just kind of have to trust that resolution is arduous job I personally find it kind of difficult to look at intermediate stages of logical inference and really getting his intuition about individual pieces but that's why you define the principles prove that the right and then you trust to summarise we've talked about promising to logic AND Foster a logic sulphur inference in propositional Logic you could just do more checking which means that converted to a csp and solve I mean first or logic and there's no waited in memory of the pathway inflamados toucan but in certain cases you can propositional eyes and you can reduce Force Isaac to pop in certain cases or you can stick with inference rules if you stick with different towards you can use more respondents arm on the horn clauses or you can if you don't want to restrict A1 classes you can use resolution and always seem that's different about 4 so logically reserve plus plus which means that you have to use unification unsub clip-on final takeaway is yeah there's a lot of details here but I want to stress the importance of logic as expressive language to represent knowledge and reason with that and the key idea in first-order logic is the use of variable very not the same as variable as csp those variables are propositional symbols which are like the simplest wide awake festival with kind of gone up layer in the Express of hierarchy variable security allow you to IKEA compact representations to a very the wrist so again you remember anything just to remember the takeaway that logic allows you to express very complicated and big thing museum.of small ok so that's it I'm Wednesday and give me a lecture on the floor and there is one and then we have the poster session after Thanksgiving and then the final Tokyo Tower ok I will see you at the poster session and good luck on x
