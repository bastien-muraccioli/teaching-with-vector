alright let's get started please try to have a seat if you can find a seat and let's get the show on the road so welcome everyone to see h221 this is artificial intelligence and if you need to send for welcome to Stanford supposed to do some introduction so I'm Percy I'm going to be one of your instructors teaching this class with Doris over there so someone to say hi and up recorder and we also have a wonderful teaching team so these are your serious so it obviously is could stand up and I'll give you each personal opportunity to say 3 words about what you're interested 18 years on the back what are on the slide ok so as you can see we can have a very diverse team and so when you're thinking about going to find a project later in the Quarter you can tap into this an incredible resource I'm so 3 quick announcements so there is going to be a section every week which will cover a both kind of a review topics and also advanced topics so this Thursday does going to be overview and if you can and Rusty on Python a rusty and probability come to this and will get you up to speed homework the first homework is out is put on the website it's do next Tuesday at 11 so remember the time that matters all Solutions were beyond done on Great school just give me a critical postcode that will be posted so look out for that ok so now let's let's be done so when is first teaching this class 7 years ago I used to have the motorway why I was important and why if you studying you have 11 pack in the world I feel like I don't ruin you to do that now it's time to pick up the news in the morning you hear something about your AI and a deal with a lot of success stories play jeopardy or Play-Doh dodo to human-level performance it can also read documents and answer questions to speech recognition face recognition on medical imaging and all these tasks or are you read about how successful these are technologies have them and then if you take a look at outside the kind of the technical circles there's a lot of people on imposing what is going on with ainuu care about all these kind of very bright claims of how transformative I will be to the Future of work and the society and some wine and even some kind of boring on a pretty so what can have in a future no one knows but it is fair to say that I have will be Transformer of but how do we get here and to do that I want to take a step back to the summer of 1956 so the place to start college John McCarthy who is in an MOT and then after that confounded a separate organised a workshop at doughnut college with some of the best and brightest Minds of the time where the Minster yard Shannon and soul and they had this not some auriscope of trying to think that every aspect of learning or any future intelligence could be precisely capture so I machine can me to simulator so they were after a the big question of how do you can solve I didn't make that much progress over the summer programmes an interesting artefacts came about from that time on the programs at checkers or prove I theorems and sometimes even better than what the human proofer look like and there was a lot of optimism people really really excited and you can see this quotes by all these exciting people who proclaimed a out of his sword in a matter of years but we know that didn't happen there is a folklore example machine translation so if you take an English sentence like the spirit swelling of the flash's you translate into Russian which is what the choice Language by the US government at the time and you could translate back into English and you get the vodka is good but the middle is wrong I think I was too funny so the car finding and everything on the first day of winter so is it is a period where you research was not very active it was all well so what went wrong here smart people right ahead of themselves so two problems one is that the computer was simply not there millions or even if you compare the last time we have right now and also the problems away the formulae them in exponential search which how much can give you have your never going to go up when that right they also have limited information it doesn't maybe more sort of find out if I give you internet compute and ask you to translate I think you would be able to figure it out because there's no competition for me just need to learn the language and you need to experience all the Salty is language to be able to translate but another hand I wasn't soft but a lot of interesting contributions to computer science came out of it list with his Halloween ideas that on underlying meaning of the high-level programming languages we have garbage collection time-sharing allowing a multiple people use this one computer at the same time which is something that we can take for granted and also this paradigm of separating what you want a computer which is modelling and how you do it which is inference which will get you all about later ok so people forget quickly and in the 70s 80s there was any new generation of people getting excited about AI again this time it was all about knowledge right now just power and the Wirral of expert systems with your creatine and ideas that you couldn't code experts knowledge about the world they could do kind of amazing things and at the times and encoded in general of rose and there were a lot of programs that was written and you know that the scope is much now or now the goes into solve it all day I but to really focus on some choice and problems like diagnosing diseases or converging customers order parts and apart and customer orders into parks and this was the first time that a I think really had a real impact on industry so people were actually able to make useful your products out of this knowledge did actually play a key ingredient in Kirkby in this in your exponential growth but of course we didn't last long knowledge as it was simply not written up the capital all the time you want to save the world be required a lot of mental effort to maintain and a pattern of over promise and under Deliverance that seems to play Ai people I'm led to the collapse and all the field and the kind of s ok so that's not the end of the story either I'm going to step back further in time to 1940s what happened in 1943 so there was a neuroscientist recalling and a logician pets were wondering and marveling at how the human brain is able to do all these can complicated and they want to kind of formulate a theory about how this can all have so they developed the theory of artificial neural network I'm in this is kind of you can think about the route as did running in some sense and was interesting is that what odds are in a logic with a two things that you might not have necessary associate with each other and showed how they were kind of connected mathematics an alarm that really work in this era were coronavirus was about studying them from a mathematical perspective because at that time the computers in there you couldn't really run any training in models I'm I'm in the 1969 something interesting happened so this book by Ian Patrick perceptrons what did a lot of mathematical analysis and also show that linear models one of the results of many was sorting out our classifiers couldn't solve the exit poll the promise I know where they think the problem is basically given to inbox can you tell whether the the same not or different and so it should be a hard-on and do it and for some reason which I don't quite understand that killed off no nuts research even though they say nothing about if you had a different network what but it's often said that this work are strong things from people who are interested in your own hours to the fuel AVI being very symbolic analogic driven but there was always this kind of minority group who really invested in believed in the power of neural networks and it was just a matter of time is there is a renewed interest people Discovery discover the back-propagation algorithm which allows for a generic I will like a train these multilayer no now works because single-layer remember was insufficient to do a lot of things and then one of the kind of that really success stories as Yola and then in 1989 apply to convolutional neural network was able to recognise hand digits and this actually got deployed on by the USPS and was reading and zip codes so this is no great but it wasn't until this decade that the area of know now it's really took off under the moniker deep learning 2012 was kind of a cube transformation where they show games on the benchmark and overnight transform the computer via Community alphago no other the rest is history ok so so this heart to intellectual tradition you know the name AI has always been associated with the time John McCarthy logic all started but as you can see that there is also of him this on neuroscience inspire definition of AI in a tool kind of really had some deep philosophical differences in over the Decades fart with each other kind of quite a bit but I want a pass for a moment and think about give me directions to MDL power connections here remember they were studying artificial neural networks but the connection was 2logic right so from even in the very beginning there is kind of the synergy that you're some some people can open over can you take a look at alpha girl which if you think the game of go or minigames it's a mathematically you can write down the rules of go in logic and just a few lines was a mad like with well-defined logical logic puzzle and sometimes but somehow the power of neural networks allows you to develop his models that actually play Go you really really well so this is going to one of the deep mysteries that has I think it's opens a standard challenge as with any story is not a full picture and I want to put on this why that drawn from a lot of different many of the techniques ever going to look at for sample maximum likelihood came from your statistics or games confirms economic optimisation gradient descent into was in a 50 completely unrelated to AI but these techniques can have develop in a different context and so I kind of like in New York City it's melting pot where a lot of the these techniques a kind of unified and apply to an interesting problems and that's why it makes it I think really interesting because of the new avenues that are open up by and have unique combinations of existing techniques ok so so that was a brilliant Brief History of know we're how we got here no one apart from Mum and think about what is what is the call what were the people trying to do and again this is kind of this two ways to think about it which antanddec sometimes the completion of these causes a lot of confusion I thought you think about it is AI as agents in sizes the First View asks a question how can we create or recreate intelligence as one ask know how can we use technology to benefit Society this too obviously very related and they have a lot share technical overlap your philosophical either kinda different so I think a lot of water arm gets associated with AI and especially with science fiction that kind of certainly encourages that's kind of you where you're human where human beings and what you doing you look in the mirror and you say wow that's nice that's a smart person and you think OK how what what what can humans do that is your so no amazing while they can they can see and they can't receive the world recognise objects they can grasp carbs and drink water not spill they can communicate using language as I'm doing to do right now we know facts about the world the cloud and knowledge services what's the capital of France and procedural knowledge out how to ride a bike we can reason with this knowledge and maybe ride a bike to the capital of France unfortunately we are not born with reborn with basically nothing none of these capabilities but was born with the capacity and potential to acquire these overtime for experience ammonia and seems to be kinda screwed up ingredient which drives a lot of success in AI today but also with human intelligence is clear that only plays as such a central role in getting us to the level that we are offering that these areas has kind of Spawn and Harris uploads and people in it or had a wondering about how you can make artificial systems how the language are there motor or the the visual perceptual capabilities dad humans have but are we there yet I like to think that we are very far so if you look at the way that machines or having successful is always as narrow set of task and your millions of billions example and you just quite a lot of competition and you can really kind of automize any task you can come up were humans a very different region they don't necessarily do when you wanting well but they are have such a time diverse set of experiences can sort them out of task and learn from each individual task from very few example and still is a kind of Grand challenge from perspective how you can build systems with this Lovell tipper body that humans have so the other view is not basically will say ok well you know it's kind of call the thing about how we can recreate challenge bye you know we don't really care about making more things like humans really have a way of doing that's called baby's so What it's really like to do is not making something else like a human by making system to help humans because you have to over with him selfish bad we're in charge right now one of these this view and a lot of accessories in a I are really different from the things that you expect in all this the humanoid robotic arm into your house and this is a project from there's a lot of poverty in the world and understand you what's going on using computer vision on sound like to predict things like this you can also have another application for a saving energy by trying to figure out when to call us as being deployed in more and mission-critical situations such as self-driving cars or authentication the new issues that come out so for example this phenomenon called adversario examples where you can take arm reviews cool looking glasses you can put them on your face and you can for the computer face recognition system to think out your actual in your someone else or you can post these as a stickers on stop signs and get this so there's no problems if you think about the widespread deployment there's also traffic leave I also pretty no I've said which is a biased sad many of you probably have read in the news about a boy if you take Monday which is the language that doesn't distinguish in writing for between me and she and you stick into Google Translate you see that she works as a nurse but he works as a programmer which is encoding servants two-sided bias interaction models and one economy point I want to bring up is that how is machine learning and working today wow it's your society exist societe generale live data or training on the stage and kind of trying to fit a Down trying to mimic what it's doing and then using predictions on what could possibly go wrong and so certainly people like people have been thinking about how his vices are creeping up as open active area of research something is asking what systems are being deployed to Aldi's always people whether they wanted wanted or not and this is actually touches on people actually impact people's lives in a serious way so no try to predict how risky criminal record how someone obviously someone else is actually and a public organisation realise Woolwell you have a system that I'll give you the individual didn't return is actually twice as likely classify blacks incorrectly as blacks so this is pretty problematic comes back and says actually you know I think I think we've been given a risk score of 7 we were there because 60% of whites reoffending in 60% of blacks I'm not the pointed Fury's Dad no solution to this in Samsung Sally so people have fire formulated different notions of fairness and equality between how you predict record on different kind of groups I'm all you can have different notions of fairness and with all seemed reasonable from first principle mathematical TV can be incompatible with each other so figure out how to deal with the skin and I'm assuming might be using these count critical ok so summary so far there is a agents view I'm trying to really kind of dream and think about how do you get these capabilities like a learning from very few examples the humans have into your missions and maybe opening up on kind of a different set of technical capabilities but at the same time we really need to be thinking about how these systems are affecting the real world and things like security and biases and fairness all kind of show up is that a lot of the challenges in deployment of our system don't really have to do with humans and humans are incredibly by us but doesn't mean we want to build systems in our that minute humans and kind of inherit all the kind of the Flies that humans have any questions about this parts for a moment so what's going on so what I want to do next give overview of the different topics in the course and the way to think about all this is that I was trying to solve really complex problems a real world is really complicated but at the end of the day we want to produce some software or maybe some hardware that actually bronzone does stop and there's a very considerable gap between these things and even approach something like self-driving cars or diagnosing diseases just like go sit down and start typing because then there is an overarching structure so what is going to do is to give you one example of a structure which will hopefully hope you approach heart problems and think about how to solve them in a can walk principled way so this is a paradigm that I called the modelling inference and learning so the idea here is that the three Pillars explain in a bit and we can focus on each one of these things kind of internal so the first ever is modelling so what is Marlon is taking the real world which is rude complicated and building a model advent so what is a model model is a simplification that is mathematically precise so that you can do something with on a computer that's necessary is that modelling necessary has to simplify things in in your throwaway information so one of the kind of art is to figure out what information pay attention to my information to keep so this is going to be important for example when you work on your final project and you have a real world problem you need to figure out you can have everything and have to figure out you just see how to manage your inner resources so here's an example if you want to put a builder A system that can find the best way to get from point a to point b in a city you can formulate the model as a graph where nodes are points in the city and edges represent ability to go between this points with some sort of cost on the edges ok so now once you have your model you can do inference and what inference means is asking questions about your mum so here is a model you can ask for a sample what is a shortest path from this point to this point that's because now your model and is a mathematical define a problem now you can of developing algorithms to solve a problem and what of inference is being able to do this complications I'm really a fish and finally learning addresses the prom where does the small comfy so in any in a realistic setting I'm the mall might have a lot of parameters may be has and your millions of parameters and how do you if it's want to be faithful to the world how do you get all this information there nanoleaf including this information turns out not to be a good idea this in some sense what a I from the 80s was trying to do so the learning paradigm is as follows what we're going to do is specifying model without parameters skeleton so in this case we have a graph but we don't know what the edge weight are and now we haven't data so maybe we have date of the form people tried to go from x to y and they took 10 minutes or an hour or someone and then from there so that we can learn to fit the premises of the model we can assign cost to the edges that Hannah represented of what the date is telling us can you say no in this way we can write down a model without promise betadina apply generic Viagra and get a model with cameras and how we can go back and do inference and ask questions know about us ok so this kind of the paradigm and what really in vercise that learning is not as at present it is really not about any one particular out with them like nearest neighbours or no network is really a can of philosophy of how you go about approaching problems by define immoral and then not having to specify all details but telling them ok so here is that plan for the course we're going to go from love intelligence the high-level intelligence and Intelligence of of the other models that were talking on so first we're going to talk about machine learning early years going to be such an important building block of that can be applied to any of them also we answer the central 10-in machine army as you have data and you go tomorrow is main driver of one of his successes in the eye because of allows you to I'm in software engineering terms move the complexity from coated no million lines of code which is unmanageable you have a lot of data which is collected in Kenya Moore natural way and a small amount of code that can operate on this in this paradigm has really been in Tralee what is a think about in terms of machine learning is that it is requires a leap of Faith so you can go to the mechanic so downloading some machine code and you train them all but fundamentally it's a bad generalisation where you have your data you feel tomorrow I'll be you care about however Fontana didn't care about how it performs on you experience and that live theatre something that's I think gives machinery in its power but is also a little bit at first class for House medical it is how you can actually formalise a lot of this using the probability theory and statistics about that topic for another time after we talk about machine learning we're going to go back and talk about the simplest of models while so reflect model is this quiz ok what is a dynamo how did you get it so fast well it's a reflex why you're a human video system is so good add doing these things we are thinking and tomatoes are these are models which just require a fixed set of competitions so example that are linear classifiers networks I'm in most of these models are the ones that people use machine learning models almost synonymous with reflux an important thing that there is no fee for it is just I you give you import bam bam bam a rapper so that's that's great because it's fast but there are some problems that require little bit more than my soul for example there's another problem OK quick way to move for sugar this probably like a few of you I like chestiness is for the rest of us I have no idea so in these kind of situations we need something perhaps it will be more powerful than a reflex mean Asians I can kind of plan and think ahead so that ideally I stay this models that we more they were all as I said I've stayed with capture any given situation like position in a in a game and actions that take us between stays which porcelain two things that you can do in the tennis game I'm so alive game applications find this robotics on motion cladding navigation also something that are might not be you might think of such as your generation in natural language generation image you are can be cast in this way as well how to say base models each of which will cover in in a week's time so such problems out the class you can try everything so you just trying to find ultimate pass their cases where this randomness for example if you're trying to go from point a to point B maybe there's traffic and I don't don't know about in a game that might be better and others category which is cases where your plane opponent was actually trying to destroy so what you going to do about it so what are the games are going to be talking about when we talk about this I want to assignments is actually building a pattern agent such as this so why were you looking at this think about what are the states and what are the actions and how would you go about your devising a strategy for Pac-Man to eat all the dart in the boiler Coast so that something to maybe look forward to this competition so we'll see you ok so babies models very powerful that I love you too kind of help for sight but some problems or not really most natural way caster City so the gold Sudoku is to fill in these blanks with numbers so that every row column and three can a sentence which you have to do in a certain order where is the the weather in how you move in in Chester something is pretty important I'm so so this type of problems I have to buy these variable base models where are you can think about the solution to the problem as an assignment to the individual variables under some constraints so I can spend a week on these are hard constraints for example two people can be a person can be in two places at once which was about which are tomatoes with soft dependency you're trying to track a car overtime use all the positions of the car the variable composition of the cars and these use represent on the the sensor readings of the position of the corridor particular position inference looks like trying to figure out where the the car was given all this can noisy sensory so that's also give me another time ok so finally how we get to hell of a WhatsApp what is high level intelligence in Logic I'm Furbies and I yeah so the question is why is not why is a problem not a space spaceman you can actually formulate this is a stupid small but I just think about the sequence of assignments well turns out that you can formula in a more natural way as a verb a small of which allows you to take about out some kind of more efficient algorithms to solve it's think about these models is kind of analogy is like a programming language so yes you could write everything in your cplusplus but sometimes writing in your python.org or sequel for something mighty moron Maggie take me from you have yeah so question is how do you categorise CBS models where there is both round as an adversary we're gonna talk about those as well those with by them as adversarial but there is also random component I have to do came back Richer Sounds yeah so question is about whether or some of these are more continuous in some of the more discrete I don't necessarily think of so a lot of the reflex models actually can work in continuous I'm actually it's almost opposite where the logic is models or in substance more discreet but you can also have continuous elements I'm as well so in this class were mostly going to focus on can discrete objects because they're going to be simple to work ok so what is this logic so the dad suppose you wanted a little companion who you boss around and and help help you do things that's a better way to say so you like to be able to say OK Google tell us some information and your then later you want to ask some questions and have a sister required so you're how would you go about doing this and one where you can think about is building a system that you can actually talk to using natural language going to show you a demo which is going to come up in the last assignment or logic ok so this is going to be a system that is based on Logic that I'm going to tell the system amount of things let me going to have some question so long and see if you can play the role of that Alice is something no WhatsApp Quiz answers is Alice student ok I'm is Bob a student sansevieria ok so analysis to students people Alice is not a person I'm by that ok so ok no it's some reasoning right it's using logic it's not ok so now let's do Alice is from Phoenix Phoenix is a hot City I know because I love her cities are places if it is snowing it is and then so is it snowing so how about this ok so a person is from a hot place and it is cold are you alive and California with maybe appreciated ok so is it snowing now how many snowing Harry is a now don't know how do you say Alice is happy ok tell me the snowing now ok so you guys we gonna do this ok so this is an example of interaction which if you think about it has is very different from Hollywood see you can have in a typical ml system we have to show it you millions of examples of one particular thing and I can do one this is much more of a very open-ended set of experiences are super rich but they're different diversity I just give one statement I say it once and then all the sudden has all the ramifications and kind of consequences that built and understands and I can't sleep I've got this is based on your logic systems so it is brutal but this is just a proof of course to give you a taste of what I mean when I'm so so this is his heterogeneous information and reason people without information it will see how the logic systems can do that ok so that complete the Tour of the topics of the class no I want to spend a little bit of time on course logistics so I want all the details here are online so I'm not going to be completing my coverage and I just want to give you general centre what's going on here ok so what are we trying to do in this course so prerequisites programming and probability do some mouth and some basic groups are the classes that are required or at least recommended if you have an experience that I'm worry what to do hope to get out of this course someone had the courses meant to be giving you a set of tools using a modelling inference learning paradigm and give you a set of tools and a way of thinking of how about problems that hopefully will be really useful for you when you go on the world and try to stop and also I buy as a by-product I also one of you to be more efficient at no matter program because those are the core elements that enable you to an interesting things ok so the coursework is homework exam in a project that's what you have to do horses eat homeworks each moment is a mix and Friday written improving problems central on a particular application covering one particular type of model in Central before there's a competition for extra credit is also some extra credit problems in endowed when you submit code we're going to run that we have another way that runs it's all the test cases but you get a feedback on this upset so you can it's like you have a train setting you have a test so don't rain on your test that ok so the exam is taxing your ability used the knowledge and you learnt to SORN your car so there is on I think it's worth taking a look at him because this surprises people have a little bit different than the title from that you see on the homework and their work anymore problem-solving so there's multiple choice like ok you know when was perceptrons published something like that it's going to be really cold how do you know and how do you come up with and they're all going to be written Close back it's up for you have I wanted notes and this is a great opportunity to actually review all the material and actually learn the the continent so the project I think it is a really good opportunity to take all the things that we've been talking about in the class and tried find something you really care about fighter pilot working groups of three and I really recommend finding a group early.in size is your responsibility to find you a good group later like one week before the project finance definitely or something really tried this down use psr-2 or your other social networks to find a good the three quarter determine these milestones for the project so to prevent us from procrastinating until the very end so that's going to be a proposal where are you trying to race on some ideas progression for a poster session which is actually before final report I'm an apprentice very open so this can be really liberating but also what is daunting we will have to give you a lot of structure in terms of saying ok how do you define your task how do you implement different explain later help you evaluate how do you analyse what you've done and it's product group of your sign as a mentor to help you through the process in you're always welcome to come to my office hours are any of this year's to get additional help either brainstorm or figuring out what the next step some policies are old assignments scope there is 700 days you can use a most to persimmon after that there's no we're gonna use piata for all communications I don't email leave a post on if I can make it public if it's on it's not sensitive but if it's in your personal then obviously make a Friday I'm trying to help you what actually awarded some extra credit for students to help answer the other students questions holiday shows Armagh someone last thing and it's really important and that's the Honor piss off especially if you've probably heard this if you've been accepted if you haven't then I want to ruin cannot make this clear so I encourage you all to and collaborate discuss together but when you get one account actually the homework you have to write up your homework and your kodi in the panel so you should be looking alright someone's right up you shouldn't be looking at a code you don't my Superdry copying code off if github that's hopefully should be obvious maybe you should not please do not post your homework I know you probably proud of that is doing really well but please don't push it hard because then that's going to be honest when debugging if you working together find 2AS Isaac I'm looking in Porto properly so you can I put in invite to my past I'm getting 3 when you get so that's fine but you can remember don't like each other anything for says we're gonna be running Moss which is a software program that looks for codification arm 22 make sure that are the rules of being followed and changing one variable name is or enough said Santander app any questions I want to make sure this is the final project you can put on guitar private github Repos is fine watching the back the question is can you can you do a solo project you can do a solo project into a project with two people into project with three I would encourage you to Friday work in groups of 3 because you'll be able to do more as a group and there is definitely it's not like if you do solo project will be expecting like one-third of them OK anything else alright ok so I know final section I want to actually Delve into some technical and what they were going to focus on right now is the inference and learning components of talk about how you can approach these through the lens of your optimisation so this is going to be it might be review for some of you but hopefully it's going to be a good have your way to get everyone on same page ok so what is automation true flavours of optimisation that we care about their discrete optimisation where you're trying to find the best are the screen object for example you trying to find the best our path or is on the path p that minimises the cost of that we're going to talk about one hour Victoria basic programming which is a very powerful way of solving these complex optimisation Anarchy no property here is at the set Apart is huge and you can't trials on computer cost say something clever a s brand of optimisation is continuous optimisation in family this is just finding the best of vector of real number that satisfies or minimises summer jacket function so typical place that shows up is in learning where you define objective function like the training error and you're trying to find a way back to your w so this just means it's a list of numbers to numbers that minimises Altrincham I'm going to show that gradient descent is easy and surprisingly effective way of solving these continuous ok so to introduce these two ideas I'm going to look at you problem I'm trying to get a work through that so this might be also a good your way to think about how you might go approach no homework trying to kind of talk through this ok so the first problem is computing at this distance and you know this might not look like an eye problem but whatever ear problems have this as kind of your building block if you want do some sort of matching between two words or two biological sequences so the importance were given two strings on a board to work this out given two strings I sent to you so put out for a cat and the cats are you want to find the minimum number of edits that is needed to take transform as in to chill and I mean you can insert insert ass you can delete characters I can you can substitute one character for another two can replace a with he so you some examples what's the distance of Canon 80d to anything kind of dog is 3 cannot is one you insert I'm telling cat is 1 add a card and the cat so the challenge here is that there are quite a different number of ways to incidental right so if you have a swing of that very long just wait a minute things to like just try out all them ok so then how do we how do we go about coming up with a solution sew in ideas yeah yeah what's the problem so one thing to note is that ok where are the general principle of general principle is to reduce the problem because that you can put with sort it is easier to solve and then you can maybe get something that's ok so there's maybe two observations we can make one is that well technically saying we can insert into as but if it makes the problem larger and sometimes that's that's not that's not reducing crime but whenever inserted we probably want to insert inside your own when I cancel something out right so we went into it cater for any reason probably want it in the ass in which case as much as that and then we reduce sound problem right so we can actually think about inserting into US to ask as equivalent to Reading from from Chile so another observation we can make is that we can start inserting anywhere we can start answering here and then jump over here and do this by this introduces a lot of ways of doing a witch all kind result in the same answer so when are we just starts more systematically and one and and then just proceed and try to chisel off the problem ok so start at the end so now we have this on Prague in a drawer problem now robloxia so what sort of the end oh the quizzes wiry sunny at the end as the ideas had if you started and then you have kind of a more systematic and consistent way out you're reducing it you don't have to think about all the permutations Warrington notary dancer the right to the left to the left arm both at the end yeah the question is how do we know that starting at one end can give you the ultimate strategy so so if you want to approve this more rigorously that there's some work but I'll just try to give you a new intuitive answer suppose you didn't start at the and you just made a sequence of star like I enter here I delete here and then I went over here and did all those operations the ass I could have equivalently also just sorted those by in a where was happening and then just proceeded from one another and I would arrive at the exact same so without loss of generality I can start then another questions ok so yeah yeah so question is maybe you can recognise some pattern so I was like ok that's that's maybe it should be lined up I guess these examples are chosen so that these patterns exist but we want to solve the problem for cases where the pattern may not be obvious it could be we want to workout for it to work for all strings maybe there is no padding and we still would like to have a camera fishing cigarette just like you programming like we go one by one who is always like I don't work doing substitution on same character each mitoo what's 2 dynamic programming so that's why I'm trying to build up from a build up to you ok so so if you look at this so damn problem is a kind of general technique that it's actually allows you to express more complicated problem if the to match then well we can just immediately unless it's going to be the same right so we can go and get some free rides ok but when they differ now we have many options so what we could be do well we could Your Substitute ok we can change the teacher on apps so what is that leave us with so I can do here's the cat can you can substitute ok what else can I do someone said something I can do so I can insert insert where into pass that's the same as you're by 1 Delaney from TV so you can be forgotten this is our cat Al das from t ok so this is what's Coed it's called it in search and technically insertion and then finally what can I do I can also remove too so cat Play Services Stirling in right now you're probably like this like what obviously it's hard to tell you I just give you some strains and you know who knows what the right now I'm so in general how do you pick so here I am sorted that ass right button because there's two asses here I just cancel the marathon considering yeah yeah yeah so I'm because of this kind of trying to return the camera on ok so which one should I choose and the substitution the other way meaning change sorry there's too many accidents oh you can that's you can think about that is kind of so if you identify two letters are you want to make the same then you can you can replace someone to be the other or daughter to be officially waiting times premier as we're only added as which is the reason that it's ok so which one of these toradora bearders Dorsey yeah you could try the look inside but remember these are might be really complicated so we want to kind of a simple mechanised procedure to tell the next ladder Let's Pretend you can see inside end of the day you hope they have a prom that's simple off I'm here as you go see or something then you're done but then no how do I how do I not supposed to solve this supposed to someone just told you ok I know this course I know this cost I know this cost what what should you do yeah it's a take a minimum right I can remember one minimiser energistics so I'm the three things you can do you shouldn't have some costs of doing that action which is no one ever said it is the same cost and then there is a cost of your continuing do whatever you doing so we're just going to take them in yeah so I was trying to argue that with if you're going to write a rap yes without loss of generality because if you went left a rider in somebody order you can also replay the edits ok so what's try to record this up and see if we can make this program work so I'm going to do edit this can everyone see this ok so define a function that takes two strings and then I'm going to define a recurrence so recurrences are I just want to have Android use but this is really the way you should think about my programs and this idea of taking contact forms in breaking it down it's going to show up in problems and so I guess it's something so lots define requirements are as follows so remember at any point in time I have no problem and I'm going right a lot I'm only considering the first and letters of s in the first letter and letters of T ok so request is going to return the minimum edit distance between two things the first letters of s and the first 10 letters of tea I'm going to post this online try to copy ok so ok suppose I'm going to England to find a sponsor if I had a sunshine what should I return because of so and is integer right so and address or I'm going to return the length of laminate so that's kind of the initials alright so I know how you feel ok so that's what song consider a banjo cases easy supposed that on Amazon right so how can I empty string with something that has enlarged so what is the cost symmetrically of NRS 0 10 results for the um and then if now we've come to the end of the initial case that we can see so if the last letter of this is 0% set a timer this matches then what should I do so now reduces to a cell problem right so every have them this morning I Know Him So funky switch I looked at so there's in this case the last letter doesn't have to do something do we know been waiting until there's probably no where you can make this more efficient I'm just going to try to get the basic ok so substitute what's the cost of a substance in a one to do the substitution but and reward reduce the problem 2 am I the one in my letter from SNL upper letter from so what else can I do so I can no delete so that also cost wine and when I delete I delete from us and then and so just remains the same and then now you can think about him is an because remember insertion into acid dilution from that's why ok and then the result what is just going to be a minimum of Harry fenner so just have a call as function a cat meerkats so let me Trinity answer Civil War ok pronounce for if I can prove it I mean if you were doing this you will probably want us more about in the entry of the time everyone so we're just going to refresh ok some computing this distance between two strings I'm going to find a recurrence that works on so problem what are the sub problem is the first 10 letters of sna first and letters of and the reason I'm using images instead of strings to avoid like string copying implementation details so based cases so you want to reduce your problem to kiss words it's trivial the toll and then we have the last letter matches and then we have a letter doesn't match and you have to pay something I don't know which action to take some going to take them no minimum all them and then I call it by just going ok so this is great right so not working thing let's try another test case I'm going to make this 7 x 10 the song basically replicate string 10 times so I thought it's a long string longer string ok so now I'm going to run it Lewisham Waitrose there is a biscuit I think it works but it's what's what's wrong with this code yes it's very slow wiser slow every point request 3 time so if you can get this exponential how do you solve this problem yeah you can memorize the word which is another way to think about no worries + I guess recurrences so where did you have the uninvited in general I recommend people wall working and then trying to make a flat so don't try to be too ok so I'm going to make this cash I'm going to say if a man is in the cash then I'm going to return whatever is in the houses just a dictionary mapping the key which is identification of the problem I'm interested in solving and the resolve which is my computer safari computer that I don't need a computer again just returning and then had a hand if I have to complete it then I have to put this in so three lions yeah that's great this should be outside the request Grosvenor Garden Centre otherwise I would do in this class are you ok for you or would you rather like you can use this but I think this is your pretty transfer purposes so now in France instantaneously as opposed to euro send a check for years probably the right answer because there's four was original answer x 10 any other questions about this this is example of programming which are solar problem trying to formulate as a recurrence of a complicated form in terms of smaller problem like I said before this is going to come show up over and over again in this class the question is why does this reduce redundancy if you think about I'm just messing about arbitrary diagram here so just reduce these two and this problem gets reduced to these two and so on right so if you think about if you didn't have memorization you were just paying for the number of pass every part is the kind of you have the computer from scratch where is if you do memorization you appear in the number of notes here which a lot of this is Cher like this no matter if you're coming from here for you I'm using the same value ok so let's move on so the second problem were going to talk about is a has to do with continuous optimisation and motivating question here is how do you do a regression which is the kind of a brand butter up so so here we go regression ok so imagine you get some points ok sorry give you a point which is now 24 and then I'll give you another point that say 42 and so these Are Data points you want to say predict housing price from your square footage of something like that you want to predict health store from your blood pressure and some other things so this is pretty common in Machine Mart and the question is how do you fit a line I'm going to consider the case where your airline has to go through the origin just for simplicity assume I wanna like fine I mean maybe degenerate but that's the simple example in January have water points anyone else fit the line that's kind of is close to the point ok so how do you do this so there's a principle called least squares which says well if you give me a line which is given in this case by a slope w I'm going to tell you how bad it is and bad it is measured by looking at all the training points I look at this distances right so clever I have no this particular particular point your ex if I hit it with a w then I get basically the wine kept not like that's my prediction the real value was which is and so if I look at the difference I want a difference between 0 write Owen with squares I Square this and I say I'm want this to be a smallest possible fret now this is only for one point so I'm going to look at all the points I suppose I have endpoints and that's a function that I'm going to call w which basically says for a given weight after which is a slope give me a number that characterizes how bad of a fit this is worth 0 means and I fit everything perfectly and large numbers mean that outfit alright so so that no regression so how do I solve a regression problem how do I optimise this do you do this in your head is so if I actually have these two points which are we ok doesn't matter will work computer so how do I go about doing this so one prince of all which is there may be another general takeaway is abstract away the details you can have get and a little bit stuck but whatever you think about this app as say some function I don't know what it is this function ok so now this is a different flight now this is the weight and this is effective you always label your axes and let's say this function looks like this so which means that for a bit slope I pay this amount for the slope I pay this amount and what I want to do I want to minimise out of w which means I want to find the w which has the least value of effort question ok so you take the derivative so what is a derivative give you it tells you what about right so you look over here in general you might not be able to get there to work in this particular case you can because you can solve in close one but I'm going to try to be more general see you sorry for your this this river tells you what the f*** is decreasing removed to the right so then you can move her right it says the function decrease if you move to the left move to the last so what I'm going to introduce is this a gradient descent it's a very simple algorithm it basically says sort with some place and then computer drive it and just follow your nose new computer driven again and now your computer again and then maybe you computer says keep on going that way maybe overshoot and then you come back and then you're hopefully you'll end up at the moment so let's see what this looks like in Curry so greedy the sun is no one of the simplest algorithms bad underlies set all the alarms add new people using machine learning so that's 2 points we have a 2.0 am I going to define some functions so what is this function so I'm going to some of her all the different on so basically I just want to confirm nothing to python so I'm going to look at all the I'm points so for every x y what a model predicts is W X X Minus y and if I swear that that's going to be the The Air that I get on that point and then if I Sum Over all of these errors then I get my object array of oh yeah so you can put it rain here if you want exact time ok so no need a computer to ribbon so how do you complete it so the calculus is over rusty I want to brush up on so what's a derivative remember with taking back to why there's a lot of symbols here always remember what you taking the river ok the river of the sum is the sum of the derivative so now I need to take the derivative of this right and what's the derivative of this wow something squared you bring the two down here and now you X the derivative of this what are the river of this should be x because this is a quiet this is a constant we the room w x x ok so now let's do a gradient descent what's the nationalised with and then I'm going to just on does iterate 100 times normally you would set them so stopping condition what's the temperature ok every moment I'm going to have a w I can compute the value of the function and also take the gradient of the river twitch 1 L ok and then what do I do I take a w n arm subtract the grill remember ok I'll be alright so I take the gradient remember I want to have a gradient tells me where the function is increasing someone with an opposite direction and it is just going to be this step size to keep you things under control will talk more about next ok so now I want to do April what's going on pronounce the functions right so what's computer gradient you can see that in relation with first hour with my 10th anniversary pt3 animals support 79999 Diana and looks like it's converting to point I mean while the function value is going down from 20 to 7.2 which happens to be on the correct answer is 5. OK no that's it next time we're going to keep were going to start on the machine or electric
