this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development so today video segment is video segment little I guess we stop start over computer ok Collette star tour today the government is about polypod have you heard about polypot so this is our little small robots that we can to build a shape so that we call them configure a ball robot and the are modular Ender there is a lot of interest in this area and one of the pioneer in this area was Markham Markham was Paisley student in robotics lab in the early 90s and he is now professor teaching robotics in building very advanced polypipe systems so I'm going to show you the concept that he proposed in 94 and the sum of the realisation he made at that time Holly pond we could have the light off iPod is a reconfigurable modular robot it's made up of two types of models card segment and nose signature M3 models with two Motors force and position sensing in a microcomputer onboard no they're really cute 2004 batteries segments may be nice to each other or they may be mounting each other models neotex on any face of a note temple of motiongate aesthetically stablegate and move along straight line the rest of this video of quickly present a series of Locomotion case through simulation and implementation on polypipe set my timer by controlling behaviour how to find motion su-27 behaviour modes cod and mode in Springs mode Freedom Pass is a Weldon spring using 4 senses Enfield Council speed until it reaches a joint limit navigation here extendable to an arbitrary number of models by adding to the length of the robot is next set of Locomotion Gates combined to achieve more complex like emotion signature Audi perpendicularly interspersed between original S this game may be used as a platform to carry objects the models used large and heavy ordered maybe connect to Gateway show the robot in this game is a rubber turns the to feed or the robot in contact with the ground rotate with respect to each other slide on the ground this will create problems of the rubber trying to navigate using dead reckoning over walking on carpet play signature again interest perpendicularly between s sensors are placed on the ground and picked up by the other no sliding will occur the Volunteer Gateshead called exotic not necessarily or useful there still interest this game is called the moonwalk manipulation of large objects in locomotion can be considered equivalent simulation is not locomotion mode but it shows one possible dynamic reconfiguration of Pi call well the early realisation were really difficult and very simple birthday today there are a lot of interesting devices that can carry order simulator and I hope you will have the chance to see them later ok so today we are going to start on instantaneous kinematics and that is going to introduce the model I discussed many times before I refer to the kinematics mobile that is going to be a very important part of all what we going to do later in turn and not only the motion but also the Dynamics of the motion so you remember our first task was to try to understand how we localise the end of so we know now this thing at the end of factory and we can describe the position and orientation of that and a factor with respect to his friend so if we start moving we are going to have small displacement that we can March in time if we go to a small displacement from the current configuration so we are at a given configuration we have faith I want to say to end and we know the exposition but if we make a small displacement of data so that would be a sort of notice that we are introducing each of those join joint angles well going to have a small displacement no thanks it's not only Dr X in the position but also in the orientation and the question is what is this dog correct given that we know delta theta and we know the theatre where we are so this question finding the relationship between doctor Theatre and Dr axe is answered by A linear relationship that connects the two notice letter and also it's are connected by bye I cannot hear you it is what is this model that is going to connect the two you guessed it now it's going to be related to Dr Peter bye a m yeah so Dr axe delta Zeta or the delivery / time.and is that will be related to each other through this jacobian now it's not again involves two things remember our representation of Acts involves the position and orientation so there is apart the discusses the linear velocity and there is another part that represents the angular velocity in this fact so what we need to do is to find this relationship and established is jacobian Matrix that good night how does the space so to study the jacobian we're going to start by looking at the French emotion we're going to discuss what is how do we compute A linear velocity additional objects how angular velocity is are computed as we propagate and how we can compute the impact of angular velocity on the linear and angular velocity of the intellect so this will take place through the propagation of velocities from one point to the next an that is going to provide us with sort of recursive relation that will allow us to find the velocities and in the fact we are going to examine another or way of doing this analysis rather than propagating velocities will going to examine the structure of the kinematics of a rogue and it's impact on the end of active ulcer and that would lead us to something very interesting record the explicit form of the jacobian m that is we are going to analyse the canal and we will see that in each of the columns of this mattresses we are going to have an Association with the joint with the specific joint so if we take the first call on this first go on correspond to the first joint and it's impact on the velocity of the end effector velocity linear and angular so this is from is going to be very important in establishing the model that displacement or velocity advertisement and as in defector and this model is going to be very important also in establishing the relationship between forces what is acting on the joints depending on the type of the joint with a prismatic joint to have a force we have a joint will have a talk now if we play a set of forks the Hong the lady some resulting forces at the end effect it turned out that the relationship between thoughts and forces resulting at the end of fracture come from the exactly the same model from the same jacou lizard or relationship between velocity instead IT courses that we will use and this will lead us to it establishing the relationship between four and Force so first we are going to analyse adults a and what you need is a description of our generous gardener so we picked the joint angles as generalized coordinates but sometimes we have joint displacement if we have a joint so what we will use we will use a variable recalled queue to represent 2captcha the joint angle whether it is a prismatic or revolute joint and this is done by saying that by introducing QI as l i v i x 11 is equal to 0 or 1 it's a binary number so if we have a new joint Epsilon is 0 where is Mary J B one and Epsilon bar is the so the QI is going to be either later I or the eye following the type of the joint so with the joint coordinate vector q1 Q2 Q3 now we can go to the representation fine the relationship between the two that is between x and Q and then compute those differentiation so we can give and share as you suggested to compute this relationship and this differentiation is going to involve multi variables so xyz whatever representation we have made the alpha beta gamma and then qq1 223 so Mrs sort of Vector differentiation we have X1 that correspond to the first function F1 this could be just the coordinates explore is why etc and we have all these functions so did you call me and could be computed simply by this differentiation partial differentiation we can compute Dr x 1 as the parcel delivered password inspector Pure One and F1 is function of all the queue so we will take the partial derivative with respect to all the queues and that provides that x 1 Notre XM in the same way we take the last variable last function differentiate and attend the relation now here we have a set equation how many patients we have can you count them so we have em equations depending on how many variables number of joints how many joints we have n so it basically my questions that is expressing functions all these variables in variable tell do you have another way to write this equation so that is like little bit more compact I'm going to ride this every time so we can put it in a matrix phone where Dr ex12 does like Sammy's erector Dr axe and ok if you want to talk to you and is a vector Celtic you and the relation between the two is this matter so do you see the first column of this match how we transform a set of equations into a matrix vector phone so how do we do abusi festival what would be the first Call come on what is the first column where is it the all the coefficients of q1 so this column is battle derivative of F1 with respect to q12 partial derivative of f m with a spectacular so basically this is the match and this is precisely your jacobian which is a matrix with my n m by n and it's connecting the DELTIC UN innovo 2 you're not bad alright here is the jacobian doing this competition is simple you have different kind of representation there are different ways of expressing your position and orientation and if you got and analyse this recording you are going to find yourself analysing wolf the kinematics the representation that you and it's very difficult to make sense of what is happening so if we take an example let's take an example what is the example of writing here a connection between delta q and delta it is exactly the same as that connect cute out to it because we're doing this differentiation if you take it with this back to the time then tube that is connected to it through the same match so the element of this jacobian is the partial derivative of the function I will 2 and here is the exam it's very simple example 2 degrees of freedom with in the plane lengths L1 and L2 and our presentation is going to be just X and Y so what is x in this place ok let's do the DH parameters Andrew assignment and appropriation or maybe you can just give me directly by looking at the figure and this is finished good to know accident ok so what is x you have data 1 and 32 so x will be Direction 34b because science so it will be anyone come on the society the oneplus how to the sign oneplus beta because we are taking with and does the the signs will give you the one so here is L19 1 + L2 + sign 1 Gloucester and why so in this case to differentiate it's very simple the differentiation gives you this and now you have your mum and you could see that the first row is minus why the second drawer is just acts so the jacobian in this case is quite simple and this jacobian gives you this relation for small displacement motor that you can compute it corresponding displacement after x n for Smallville for velocities in joint space you have velocities at the end of actually this match fix has been why do you use to control the robot because you can say I'm here I would to move them to Factor with little displacement you can take that displacement and generator trajectory and compute small displacement outertale so you want to find the Delta theta that correspond to your input as you want to display the interfactor by little bit you confused the corresponding data how do you do how do you extract data from the situation Converse and using the inverse of this matrix we can compute a delta data that correspond to Dr axe and then we can drive over this and many in the silver but are driven using the inverse of the Jacobi so let's take another robot we examined and see how this extends how the jacobian becomes a little bit more complicated so this is a 6 degree of freedom that involves one is Maddie joy you remember the schematic of this robot 7233 he certainly actually is the Three and the loss rotations and we have the stable obvious for amateurs providing us with the description of links with respect to previous ones and using this we computed xyz for the position invisible 3 first component this colour is really difficult but this is x y and z and what is this vector so the Direction cosines This is the x-axis of the Lost frame that is the axis affect and effect expressed in the base frame and the second sete and this is the y-axis and this is the sea ok so let's different shape Ender ok the first one it's very simple you differentiated the first one with respect to do you get - why you get sign One sign to D3 plus sign 102 and and you differentiate with respect to you and the last component that is the Z component you got set so now are you want you to give me the second column so how do we find the second column this jacobian method we differentiate XYZ with respect to Q2 so what this should be someone said to someone anyway to do the second timer services valuable is ass it is it it has a function of keto in sign to write so the derivative of sine 20 what is the difference 92 The Saint so it will be the first the sign 1272 D3 and the second component someone the song to day free and the last one minus sign to this so that's correct so what about the colour we drive with inspector D3 rq3 this would be it is only one here so louder goodnight find with respect to Q for XYZ depend on P4 no should be zero 0 Sarah ok well here is the part of the jacobian related to East Dart y.acg that was easy what is the I mean xy&z is independent you remember because xy&z were was chosen at the response so when we moved the end effector the point is still fix so xero.com 445 and 6 ok well what seems very simple for x y and z become little bit more challenging 4 the orientation so let's take her out one or two after you remember or one or two or three Aldi's three vectors representing the direction cosines Ender if we're the delivered if it's going to be are not one or two arbitrary will be related to the cube my the bottle derivative of R1 with reflector q14 Scotland to etc so let's do that ok 5-minutes and you might be able to write a program to do it in fact and still it will be quite complicated to find all this columns but more than that what do we have here is we have a matrix that correspond to this description and which means that we are computing spending this time to computer jacobian for position and orientation represented with Direction cosines and this matrix will have dementia we found the first one the 3 by 6 and the second one 9 by 4 so it will be at 12 by 6 m so if you look at the rank of that matrix is not square Matrix it's rank is at most 6 but you cannot really analyse this Matrix and make sense of what is happening you remember there might be configuration that can bring singularities if we are using hello angle or some minimal representation and that is going to be reflected in the jacobian so I want to come in is really not giving us the properties of the mechanism in term of the linear velocity and angular velocity rather it is mixing everything up mixing the representation properties will the properties of mechanism attack tell when we have an XP and XR we as we saw different representations 4xp or 4xr we have confusion speaker cylindrical coordinates for orientation we might have low angle straight angle Direction cosines ent if we computers akobian this way that is if we compute the jacobian for the position from differentiation and from the orientation this resulting jacobian is going to be depending on the presenter and it will have dimensions that accommodate the representatives so this is not something that you want to do you are trying to find the jacobian of your robot you want to find the properties associated with the robot in term of its linear velocity and angle of Wallace this is really what we are after we are trying to find how then defective movie when we are velocities at the joints when we make small displacement at the joint what is selenium what is the angle of horse Millennium velocity and angular velocity will be related to cute and Danny is amateur that provides relationship it is basically in Matrix goodnight this is 6 / 1 linear velocity is VX vy vz angular velocity is Omega x omega omega and acute that has the number of the visa free and Miss jacobian will be sort of like the basic jacobian that is describing the kinematics independently of your representation what is interesting is this jacobian j0 wall play a very important role in the kinematics but also in describing the velocities for your representation any representation that you will have can be connected to this jacobian because any representation velocities can be connected to Linear and angular velocity these angular velocities are instantaneous so there is are there other representation of the orientation if we take 3 other angle alpha beta gamma if you think it delivered if of those alpha beta gamma they are related to Omega the unlocked the derivative of Ella angles are not angular velocity but they are related to the England velocities my other presentation buy a very simple Marvel at 3 by 3 m and using those relationships we will be able to describe the jacobian for any representation and connect 2 Jacobi if we have medical coordinator the derivative of the spherical coordinates are connected to the linear velocity by a simple Matrix that is only function of the representation obstacle coordinates if we have Ella angles we could make them to omega simply by a 3 by 3 matrix that only involve alpha beta and gamma so this relation we can see that we can connect extract for the position and orientation to the Omega and because we Omega is connected to Cuba then we can have a relationship between the jacobian associated with misrepresentation and the jacobian associated with the kinematic so here are some examples if we take our anger so if we dig alpha beta gamma and think they delivered we can see that these delivered of alpha beta gamma are related to Omega by Alexa which is in this case the sign of Alpha cosine of data so it is only a function of hello Angela if we did Cartesian coordinates the metrics that connect Cartesian coordinates to Linear velocity is simply the identity maths because the derivative of Cartesian coordinates are delivering velocity so using this step of Computing the linear and angular velocities we will be able to generalise and find the jacobian associated with any representation so did you looking for representation x is XP and XR will be as accordion recall j-ax for that specific x and this recovery and will be related to the basic security and biometrics worry is going to connect the descriptions of linear and angular representation to the end omega through this relation so here is an example if we take her Xbox as related to the through this mattress and it's that are related to Omega through this Matrix because Z and Omega are related to Cuba by Jay Z and J omega we will have this relation wish Leeds this relation that is the part associated with the position representation is simply the jacobian v associated with linear velocity free x y p that is the wishes function only of the representation or er for the rotation wish me if we combine them together we obtain this relation that is the jacobian associated with other presentation related to the basic jacobian by an e m that has original form where EP is the metrics associated with the linear motion and er is the method associated with your representation of the rotation so if we select these and coordinates BP will be what is antimatter so if we have always Counties and convenient to have only to worry about it ok you get this so now the focus is on Jay-Z we have to find chaser linear and instantaneous angular the twisted examine Tommy's for the position representation xy&z we said is the identity maths how about cylindrical Ferdinand cylindrical coordinates Rossiter and z and here is the relationship between x y and z and disco what what you need to do is to relate the differential relationship between no thanks and also Denise and you find a match and that leads to this matryx 4-cylinder code what is nice if you go and store this in your library and you have access to all this you don't have to be computer cylindrical coordinates to have this matter Force medical coordinator to have this match so these are things what are there if you want to change your representation you just change your GP now for the inner angles we saw that we have another relation that is the 3 by 3 m anything special about this metrics you notice anything bad about it's fine volume down Vegas what happens when we have found a diaper 20 before we had a singularity of the representation it appears again in the velocity so when you get to that location you have a problem because every time l is equal to some integral why you have a problem and that is the problem was angle representation or any minimal representation you get a singularity in your representation that is going to leave her singularity new jacobian associated with that represent so we have established this relation that we should not worry about the representation we will find for each of the representation there is no prob all that we need is to find and establish this relation between Rio maybe and our tutors so from now on are you remove the zero Jack bass accordion is the accordion when we see jacobian it is J and physical being is relating the kudos to your linear and angular velocity and our task is to find V and Omega as a function of all these cute ok stop let's do that I'm only certain all of you understand what is the vector of linear velocity probably there is some confusion when we start propagating and moving and putting multiple rigid bodies and multiples I'm going to go little bit back and describe how we can compute linear velocity we propagate factors and we go from one leg to the next so who is a point and this point is moving with respect to something if it is moving with respect to the origin of frame a we talked about the velocity we talked about the velocity p of that point with respect to a aiding the frame now you have to distinguish between the magnitude of the velocity and it's Direction as a vector and it's components and where we are expressing this fact the biggest Factor could be expressed in creme egg we can have its component in French and also we can express it in friend be and we can have its component in frame be what is the vector representing the velocity of frame of point p moving with respect to frame a now if you want we can put it in C so don't be confused about the doctor and where we are expressing this fact and that's why I'm putting B&M specifically to show that I'm measuring the magnitude of the velocity vector of velocity with respect to frame a now let's have the following situation I have disp that is moving with respect to frame a so I have a vector representing the velocity of point p with respect to frame this now if room is moving with respect to another friend and this is because of link 3 moving with respect to a link to or whatever there is a velocity of the origin and is this velocity is the velocity of the Amazon representing representing the velocity with respect to friend be the question is what is the velocity of be with respect to frame B what would be the obviously it's going to be the sun of the velocity in respect to frame end of velocity what's the origin with respect to friend so you do are these two vectors and that is the velocity the point p with respect to frame be here we discussed the motion of the frame the frame with respect to B and this motion is uniquely produced by a translation with a velocity va the origin of that frame with respect to b it becomes little more complicated when you have a rotation so suppose you are translating and at the same time you are rotating so we need to introduce the effect of rotation when we rotate a frame different will move at different velocities right so if you're repeating an object depending on the axis rotation this point is moving faster than this I'm writing about the sax actually I'll look after the rugby point that will I have zero velocity do you know which point will have liver the points that life on the axis of love so if we take an apple and we will beat it about this access downloaded some points that will not rotating that actually The Voice on the outside will be rotating more and what you are concerned with is if I have a vector of instantaneous velocity what are the linear velocity at different point located my a vector p and that is the question we need to answer do you know the answer not yet free 4 mins EuroMillions so we have an axis of rotation we have always 6 pound just doing a Puritan service points R6 end let's have a skinhead simpler to see obviously the points closer to the axis are going to at lower velocities let's pick a point b and with concern with the velocity at this point the angular velocity measure this axis is omega and Omega stuff is representing the vector and magnitude now what is what is the magnitude of VP and it's value given that we know it's location p and widowmaker well Festival we need south of likely ok to be with respect to some free and we need to make sure that this phone is not moving so we put a frame on the axis so the origin of the frame is fixed with respect to this rotation and relocated with actor ft ok now we have everything we need to find the p so let's see the magnitude of VP is going to increase with the magnitude of omega that makes it you going to increase with the distance from the centre which is the vector p x the sine of the angle fight between the two axis right the further away from the centre the largest the BP is going to be and we can notice also that BP is Dagenham omega axis of rotation for the velocities automotive and also tagamoto location the vector locating that point because we are taking the point from the fixed point so that means with all of these that means what rupee is equal to when you have like factors that all together now and you have the sign then you will have Cross crossword which means which one is first ceviche is equal to cross product of what by what volume up two choices I said will you will not in 4 minutes and it is all swollen and so here is the answer what is the answer that is only across it's not be cross Omega by the way we will CP Cross Cross to produce the tour there is no relation so here we have velocity you have Omega you have the point now you can imagine on the same figure that instead of omega non planning a talk and the result will be a force and there is a similar relationship between the and in that case the relationship will be involving the distance first times the force to produce the torque ok we will see that later probably on Monday stop now we have this relation linear velocity is the angular velocity cross the distance it is represented as a vector Marvel hair what we need to do in order to go to the mattresses we need to introduce a metrics representation that is instead of writing what are vector representation I need to write this in a matrix form so how can we Toby is a vector now and see is a vector and a is the vector transformed into this matrix operator that does for you the a cross b so we need to find this a heart that operator is equivalent to a cross are you familiar with this the cost private operator so this is essentially Akuma tricks Askew symmetric Matrix who's swaggersouls 0 and which is formed directly from the vector a a X Minus y z component and it is non symmetric Matrix and you start with a vector a if you take this voucher and put it in this mattress then you get the metrics that operate on the bacteria to produce the cross father after vector and that will be your resulting linear velocity in the case of omega-3 ok so we represent a heart as this operator alright so in our case VP is Omega hard cross director p and Omega is this much so this is something you might need to remember ent just write down and put it somewhere Indiana let's use it so now that we are going to combine linear and angular motion the new velocity there in that frame is going to involve this Omega Crosbie and this will be added to the factors that you have the velocity of the point coming from the linear motion the velocity of the origin and the velocity due to this rotation and this is Omega Cross the vector of locating the Bond now be careful about where you express your vectors because if we say we are going to compute the quantities to express them in frame a the result has to be expressed of Eastham should be expressed in frame so if we have the Victor expressed in frame by have to transform me to frame a and then do the multiplication and we have to express this in frame so that the whole result is finally in French so you have to make sure that Eastern worries Factor is expressing the same it doesn't matter which frame it is but it has to be in the same frame and if you need anything and everything has to be transferred to a wow we went past good we're ready now we're going to take those Concepts and now applied onto our mechanics and I think you you're we're going to skip the movie segment we will see it on Monday so the way we're going to proceed is bye bacon goes velocities from one frame and taking mirrors velocities and propagating them as we move from 1 L to the other until reaching the velocity V and Omega so this propagation is going to involve to velocity the linear velocity V and the angular velocity omega alright and when we get there we will have the jacobian that will be in the total velocity that is once you reach V and Omega you will have Intercity Express of physical being x Peter which you can text so let's start with the linear horse so here let's take a vector VI and Omega I describing the velocities of this origin a frame and the rotation of the frame with respect to Omega I that is representing the instantaneous velocity and let's go to the next frame where we have annual velocity linear velocity I + 1 and new instantaneous angular velocity omega so what is the resulting linear velocity VI plus one as related to the velocity VI So Festival don't look at your notes and list see if you have International so what did BVI + 1 as a function of the eye is it smaller or larger VI + 1 is going to be equal to is it related to the Eye by any chance translation everything is moving with the eye so the VI plus one is going to have the eye in there without that but there are two terms m a the first one is Omega eye crusty eye + 1 you didn't tell me why maybe now I'm telling you what does the term tell me why yes movement in this frame linear elastic so the meaning of velocity is computed as the origin of that train track so the Omega involved will not be Omega I + 1 the large Omega I + 1 this instant in location here if this is our only joined this will be rotating this rotation will not change the velocity here what will change the velocity here is the rotation Omega eye this point by located by this fact so this would be Omega I wish is here Cross this factor locating this phone so this is the first term now anyone can explain the second yes play Christmas the second term only appears if that joined busy as was not overly joined but was a prismatic joint that is translating along the Z axis so along the i + 1 and the magnitude will be the Deep I + 1 B is a variable in this case for the prismatic so this is the day that I park Swansea I + 1 is the local velocity in frame I passed one of that point and the Omega eye crusty eye is the contribution of the rotation of the frame and plus all the translation what happening before designer Vienna that's one this will appear only if this was not revolut it it was prismatic and it is Translate long does the eye Plus two-headed arrow what is a think now what about angular we are concerned with what is omega I + 1 as a fraction omega so if the joint I + 1 was prismatic so there is no rotation between the what would be Omega I + 1 Pentecostal nearby if it is overloaded then there will be the Omega I plus one that will be added and Omega I + 1 is simply the afida eyebrow one along VI Plus so to propagate from one frame to the next what we need to do is to take this distillations and go from the bay the fix base where v0 is 0 is attached to the ground and Omega 007 is no motion and propagate to the end and when we stay and we are going to have the v associated with in the factor that Omega associated with into no inverse relations what do you see you see that you are using the Dot and say hello and the kinematics obviously dizziak so that means we are going to be able to computer the photo velocities V and Omega at the end effector as a function of the day today and the details all the kudos yes friends Ross can you put the tea light bear revolute joint I'm iron in their revenue joint joint in a frame omega plus 1 or a prismatic joint depending on the nature of the joint either gibbet or you get the Omega I ok so when you do this competition you are going to have an expression of the total linear velocity is total angular velocity as a function of the digits or the papercut thought project 1 v 1 and Omega 1 candy Express in frame 1 and this is going to be sort of using this relation to computer am I plus 1 initial frame this would be expression for I + 1 and this one Texas because we are expressing all this in the frame I plus 1 we are going to find the total expression of the velocity in the frame in as we propagate once you reach the final velocities in friend and you can transform them back the base frame and that will give you the total velocity identify actor in France areas where did you get Victor the previous night Omega eye Plus repeat that when you get the song ok so Omega eye plus one is the angular velocity associated with the motion of joint I + 1 if the joint is revolut and is the dentist the velocity vector is about the vector Zi + 1 so this is a unit vector and the magnitude of the velocity is proportional to theta but I + 1 so this is actually enjoyed I passed if you think that deliver do you remember realigned the the rotation of each point along the Z axis so that is where it comes yes what's 1 + 1 + 2 Aline Dizzee I play what will the mean it's not that far VI + 1 + not adding the Duck it is it is it is play Thunder is a scalar and the VI is about so no this is not a dark product this is just as a scalar multiplication other questions yes Express plus 1 4 kinetics you gonna get using here for the propagation is taking the velocities and propagating to the end so we complete that in French and at the end if you need them in 70 we do the transformation back to France Sarah this is that the way this algorithm is that you can do the competition backward and you compute everything in frame zero oil actually the most efficient place to do this competition you know where not a friend zero or a frame n it is in the middle because the formations becomes more and more complicated in if you go from there base to the edge in the middle of the transformations are simple so if you transform just to the middle as you propagate you will get the most efficient for in this algorithm we are showing that if we use or I + 1 we will end up with velocities Omega in and VN that will give us the total linear and angular velocity in French and if we need them information that is fine otherwise which transformer them here now what is the jacobian in all of this anyone can see the jacobian I just I told you this recursive operation we operation from shooting the velocities before cooking you cannot see it well it is there have to find it like you have to go inside so you write out the relationship you do the propagation what do you need to extract from those expressions to find a jacobian you need to get the data that iPod 1 and iPod one out and everything else is going to give you this call on something so you cannot really see it but it is there now what certification is really nice numerical but it doesn't give you any idea about the structure about the contribution of the joined about your kinematics and it is not really the best way to analyse your Mac what you going to do with going to in fact analyse and work with the explicit form of the Jackal that would allow us to really look at the mechanism and see imagery this recovering metrics and it's called and it's tracks so next time when we analyse this procedure code you will be able immediately to look at the mechanism so now you see the Stanford seminar you look at Staffordshire and you see this is the first column this is the second column this is a sitcom this is how how the chicken is going to before we leave what don't don't still have your lovin just as an example this example is useful if you are if you went really to understand little better velocity propagation and this example is done over a very simple 3 degree of freedom mechanism we know the answer of physically and you know the jacobian for this is euro play the one that you can write x y and z wishes everyone cosine later 1 + L2 cross line one and two and three cosine 123 and sign and you didn't fit a differentiation and you find your jacobian at the same time if you do it through velocity propagation using this relations you go to the first propagation the brace is add 0 you compute the linear velocity at P2 you computed you got this expression you confused the velocity of just take a look at this example where's you completed the population you find out your Omega Factor is the sum of the velocity which way is essentially your total Omega is coming from these three rotations one two and three contributes to the total rotation if you're in defector and millennium velocities I'm going to be this would be the Duke of York Peter dr120 this is your jacobian for the position this is your Omega solicitor Cork for domain no this week's this whole competition turned out to be well through this propagation but if you do it through the analysis what you doing to find is Ford Omega you see here what do we have 001 001001 what is this 001 this is Eve actor Omegas are rotating about the vector which mate is essentially the jacobian associated with angular version is simply the z.i. vectors associated with the joint angle what is this well I mean this could be directly computed from the partial derivatives or it could be computed from discuss further of note Joe angle rotations with the point locating that the Lucy that structure next time and then you can see much better the properties of the jacobian as relates to the kinematics of November I will see you on Monday
