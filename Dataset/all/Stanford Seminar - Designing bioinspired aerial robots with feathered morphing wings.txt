about my work on by inspire design and building feathered morphing wing robots bonfire design starts with biology pretty amazing creatures that can fly in just fly better than just anything there size current aerial robot beagles that can fight and stay in flight less complex promotions such as peregrine falcon and the pelican what they can do as they can take the wings in die that really high speed so this peregrine falcon fire at sea that to 200 mph antagonist wings and grab fish from the air into the water at 60 ft spend most of their lives in the air and they can't even sleep and what they do if they can find me to the wind shapes in order to get the optimal shape for different wind conditions these large wing shape changes is something that we can call it be described as a wing more thing encompasses any large wing shape changes my research Focuses specifically on morphine wings I can extend and take down gliding flight easily outmaneuver current flying aerial robots birds with other winged robots are similar size I'm using a 5-point scale and this is how falcons compared to say it yourself comparing for robustness which is the ability diversity and inclusion and brother much better at being able to hit things in carry on with our flight then quadcopters can adaptability which is the ability to change shape adaptor different wind conditions compare lamb for flight speeds glide ratio new verbally which includes turn radiators and turn speeds are fairly balanced across all five of these categories and when we compare them to similar robots they generally exceed the performance of robots and especially in those top 2 categories the metrics of robustness to collision as well as he that ability of wing shape wedding soft feathered morphing wings maybe we can help design robots that can improve in these metrics are you biological measurements in order to understand how birds accomplished these women working when you first and then we can also apply that knowledge into designing robot I talked about how I took biological measurements in bird wings in order to design in working group start with the biology and look at the Pigeon wing anatomy Indian wing we have flight feathers that lie against to major bones in the wing there is the owner and the cargo metacarpus that lies between them and it's actually with that activates riding muscles so it's different than our arms birds have most of their feathers lie between their hand in their arm having thus additional joint here the primary feathers makeup the hand wing so these are the ones that are further out and in their secondary feathers that they get most of the are mine and this is what makes up the flying services as a bird and then always flight feathers insert into a sick ligaments cold lies along laposte tedium mechanical measurements I defined the wrist angle as the angle between the two bones the owner in the caravan park and then that's projected onto that that's on the aeroplane angle between the and what makes it so for the second that physically the angle between the Bone and The Feathers and say attack play m i project the access at the feather as well as the owner in order to get the effect of Engelbert measurement purposes study of guiding pigeons done long ago by scientists in pennyquick free leaguelane pigeons haven't shown to Glide in a wind tunnel in a dark naturally adapt different posture is a different Steve play time to do it like to attack in at higher wind speeds in order to reduce the wing profile drag animate extended lights at the extended wings more at slower speeds in order to treat more left this ties back to that matrik of adaptability of wing shapes in different wind conditions in so from this study we know that pigeons do that and they can adjust airplane forms accordingly how big is the able to achieve these wings shapes is it something that I wanted to investigate and if we can find that mechanism we can then apply it to designing bio-inspired robots and we can help robots become more adaptable get to robotics design I first measure the biological mechanism that happening within the wing that enables the pigeons Tamworth its wings I can feel a model that can be translatable to the McCann in this experiment I use the motion capture system in order to measure the locations of the bones within the wing as well as all the fellas so placed markers that are tat the customers that are inserted directly into the bone which is why I used for cadavers because of the invasive and basic procedure place markers along every other so these are all 27 Fighters within the wing the most another wing to each of pennyquick site position site conditions please see the wing fully sending the primary and secondary feathers in that like fully extended position suppose the the wing into the mid tax position as well as the fully tax position contract emotional please 3 poses we're also really interesting in the continuous motion the bird to flow seamlessly across all these hoes and adjust and instead of 32 sweepers so wing through its full range of motion are away from flexion to extension resume the position of the bones in all the feathers as I do less and I take measurements of three different individuals with 12 Cycles each we can calculate the motion of all the bones in the sellers from these measurements I can plat the wrist angle which is the input angle on the X Factor have the measured feather angle along the y-axis centre parted hair is the average in a standard deviation for the feather S10 what is the one closest to the bye like that is within a wingback hero part just disabling across the wing use the S5 which is a middle secondary feather this is p10 is a wrist within the wrist T5 with a maid primary feather and then the furthest winter feathers p10 with these data we can so we can see that the relationship between the wrist angle and the feather angle is fairly linear Square set to find a linear transfer function in order to mathematically map with a predicted that England would be for a given risk single input answer my 20s feathers is only a function of the right thing or we can think about the entire wing as it's a similar underactuated so just by actuating the right thing or we can control the motion of all the fellas within opening so another thing is that these are data from both flexion and extension and so there's no hysteresis meaning that even when the word opens and closes its wings the feathers move hand along the same path in both directions function of the function stop the slopes as a sensitivity to the resting on so depending on how much for the single moves will affect how much the feathers also to the body have a slope of less than 1 but they're not moving much when the resting on me fellas the ones for this out have a rewiring do angles and I'll leave a lot compared to what there is so funny when your transfer functions derived from the kinematic and kinetic measurements we can down model the motion of underactuated feathers what does linear model to create stick animation of the win anything think of this as a rough prototype that lays out the the robotic mechanism have had a built-in under actually jumping here's a little animation why have the honour the the purple lines are within the bone with all and the cabinet carcass in this case I also include a single joint in a single joint enables a wider spread as a fully extended wing and I have the finger coordinates of the rest so really it's just the wrist as it input angle I can predict where the feathers will be for every input and single because of the measurements are made in is linear and the linear transfer functions animated model of how the seller should slow and at every input christingle the first step to help me design or about a queen describe how the feathers moved within a wing it doesn't necessarily it again to why or how we would have to go about building something that moves Like This Christian the implementation of under actuation and deactivating motion I go back to the anatomy remember that ligament in involuntary smooth muscle that lies lies between each of the feathers translate biology into mechanical design and I apply to make this as a series of linear Springs that's a move in between each of the fellas pass this approximation I created a model with linear elastic Springs between each Flight Centre at the fraction extension happens only within the plane of the wing each attached to the bone via fixings pin joint the only have one degree of freedom and rotating in that plane games of the spring attachment is estimated from a biological measurements additionally that the the spring I'll have a bit of pretension even in that tap flying positions that means that there is still holding out the wings in that tax position as opposed to completely relax when I was walking around with him assume that the firm furthest twintip feather is rigidly attached to the Bone In really is the bone kind of fuses around that last for the normal Force the four that takes for the birds stretch and expand its wings the latin perpendicular on to that last though and then for the boundary condition closer to the body there's a lot of other smaller feathers here and so I'm not all that and spring attachment as a moving one moving as the average of this others next to it seem that more thing is quasi-static so every resting all the feather the fellas are moving that kind of static at each listing linear model I know the position of every single feather forgiven wrist single and I can also see that the sum of the moment around that fella is 0 and so I can solve for the stiffness of you to the springs because I know that the springs a ponytail it was in a father and a son 0 calculation to this is an example of one feather but if you do this as a system of equations across all 20 feathers I can set up a matrix equation that allows me to solve for all the different spring stiffness is k for each pose for each other singles and then predict what the average size should be between to the fellas does party hear the bar chart shows the relative stiffness of the spring between each other for each other feathers 151 different christingle poses like Father position doesn't know that the springs and the springs are stretched from end-to-end the lower stiffness is also between P1 and S1 sense because that's where the feathers separate a lot and you expect to have something that's lasted till now the birds to Tralee stretch and heading in that area a really high at the wingtip feathers which also makes sense because you don't want the feathers separating when you have high wind conditions you actually want the feathers to be much more stuff now that we can model the kinematics or the motion of the centre shaft of the fellas what's a closer look at the feathers surfaces in that photo because if the feathers surfaces that make up the surface of the wet provide lift for bread as a fly a continuous wing Oval the way that the outermost fertiliser under the next you can see that in a cross-sectional view on the bottom right-hand of with their the circles represent the radius that centre shaft in the mains that the next feather under aerodynamic loading the bottom that pushes up against in a neighbour and so then I can contact to create a continuous surface all the way across the wing where the weather is not wonder the next all the way down until the closest went to the bar therefore all the feathers are continually in contact with each other white against each other as the bird in the morning it's wings well it's fine it seems like feathers in the fellow services are important things to look at since the building blocks of a bird wing I want to take a closer look to understand what makes them so special that is a made up of keratin proteins which is the same as your hair the single Strand that they're actually highly hierarchical in their structure jerry can see a Feather where you have the main central shaft which is the richest and then there's a soft veins on either side and that's what creates the aerodynamic surfaces zoom in you can see that swimming into the section you see that Central again and then now you can see closer the veins are actually made Betta fish next to each other so that you can see that each bar has a stiff sensory MS and then they have rent in Barbados zooming into that tomorrow to get exactly how I could call you spell poser turn cells also have these branching structures called cilia and now we're really into the microscale indespension still there done that stick up and out-of-plane and that's what interacts with the neighbouring settlers and so we can see how we interact by taking CT scans I've cooked a decent pillars scan this is a 3D rendering about CT scan as we're looking down and you can see how the p5 feather overlaps and the P6 feather a cross-sectional view of that 3D rendering and you can see how that might was microstructures interacting so there's some bottom rain down and then there's his out-of-plane microstructure is that well you really can't see in this you because the resolution of the CT scanner isn't quite good enough resume in the morning looking at least to the individual feathers we can get a better as solution and so I work with carburettor to salehoo image individual starters using a high-energy beam line CT scanner at argonne national Laboratories and she took small sections of individual sellers in order to get that in order to find the resolution to figure out what the shape of those microstructures really like clearly that those hugs bottom end of the Ramos that lacks on to the loo pizzeria that stick up and out-of-plane turn these fractions into 3D forms how many inter that lyrics Aaliyah that really is a hug that happened on a plane and then the rainbows that will scoop in an interest new scanning electron microscopy in order to look down and see what the surface of the structure you looking down zooming out we can see that there's actually I feel them within the centre surface these as a bunch of piglets can interacting with the top and so if these are kind of like probabilistic fasteners or something that you're there more familiar with is my like an okra the feathers Inn have a special micro microstructures and cousin when they interacted each other to Hook together really far deep into the microstructure so it's has come back out and try to figure out like how that affects the strength of the feathers interacting themselves Florida test how is Michael such a sexual behaviour feathers fighting next to each other I do this experiment right Paul fellow's a parts in four different directions so infection and extensions of the usual extending and as well as just to be fair out to test the services moving in the anterior and posterior Direction is a video of separating funnel as a part and you can really see that sticking mechanism happening the feathers together from falling from pulling a part when the brakes and the swings and CC the forces opposing the motion really high function which is taking the wings in until a slide with really low forces testing in the posterior and anterior directions and so we found that not only do for the microstructure is is palisade fencing like velcro it's also highly directional which is pretty unique therefore that further able to keep the feathers from separating apart when they're able to prevent the feathers from separating when they're extending their wings during flight go back to robotic design logical measurements of the further kinematics we developed in the mirror spring model in order in this houses design a mechanism to build into a robot that can actually eat like an enable the wings to actually all the feathers in an underactive way really deep into the further microstructures and learning about direction of holistic fastening we also realise that feathers are really unique micro out really unique structures that we can't fully referenced replicate artificial leaves and so this is a big motivation for us to design is biohybrid wings so using the feathers in Arabic design aromatic for aromatic when we use these real bird feathers in here this is how we built a robotic wing so we have an active skeleton and the skeleton structure is based off of the shape and motion of the bones devise two servers that can control the wrist single as well the thing on Howard skeletons control fantastic the skeleton and controls the Ri also have a series of elastic bands and so this is what we're trying to this is what we implemented from the kinetic measurements and each elastic band is tuned bass office sicknesses that was calculating they make the same the same the same solicitors newsreel pigeon Palace in order to capture that same property of fellas being able to slide against Nutella into hook only during extension the active skeleton in the last equipment and label the under actuation and theravada Queen morphing continuously as we activate as he actually just the rest in the finger angles this screen we can test premier teachings that aren't practical to do with wheels question what is the wing perform under aerodynamic loading what are the roles elasticity in further contact like is it really necessary to have both look like when one of them is actually air dynamic learning please machines me please are Wing into a wind tunnel in here you're looking at the test section with the wind blowing from left to right at 10 degrees of an angle attack which is similar to What pigeons do when they're flying camera underneath that films like the belly up Busey with sea like a bird flying overhead play we have a terminal in squid that is upstream intersection and so this has the spinning veins that can create a turbulent different turbulence profile so that way we can test the wing in Barcelona flow or flow turbulence and also high turbulence and 10 understand the effects of elasticity and feather can't I test different permutations of the robot so first I have the original feather contact what are the colours and Arsenal against each other a different rabbi and which we slightly spaced out the feathers that they don't come into contact with each other have different permutations where the elasticity owl in place and elastic bands are intact as well as removing them and just see what happens where are images of the wing and the aerodynamic loading in the Philly Alps except for the sun and you can see that you really do need both the fellow contact and the elastic ligaments in order to create a seamless Wing remove contacts father's gap starter form between them and that really is that fastening is really necessary to keep the fellas together under aerodynamic clothing if you remove the elastic bands but keep the feather and keep the feathers in contact you can see that they tend to stay together but when you have a particular as we are posing the win I think the fasting between that isn't high enough so that's really lasts you cancer if you don't have helicon they really don't really go into a wing there is an image of all these different permutations of the winged horse within play see the gaps that took the form between the photos when there's no can't has the fellas can a sticking together when there's fellow contact but no alas issue shows even bigger gaps between them repeat the same for permutations in turbulent flow once again it really is only the wing that has both the fellow contact in elastic bands in tax that stay a continuous wings we know that both of these things are important we design when we you can see in that hernia Lomond different permutations are a lot more lot more prominent once again it really is in order more successful and we have to have it last equipment as well as the fella contact coming into can't annotated measure of a Feather motion of a right we use image processing in order to track the feather and wrist angles as a winged horse single calculator knows purple lions and that's and then the colour of the markers that you see our tracking markers that are placed onto the feathers and we can get the angles and we can measure the angles of you to the colours within the robotics we can we can play at once again that further ingle along the y-axis as well as the input christingle along x axis quantitative measure of what you can see the effects in in the video so when all the lines are kind of equally spaced with some telescope you can see that the sellers are well coordinator please me about that I contact an elastic bands when you see the zero slopes of cannibal on the bottom that means that the feathers are moving when the wrist is moving is gaps between Annesley please like differences between the slopes that shows the gaps that happened between you to the fellas when you both elastic and fellow contact and also have a continuous pain time form passing we built a full more thing about it wing and able to test it in outdoor flight testing in more activity morpho wings counting on a traditional RC fuselage with a propeller that provides dress Dubai hyperbat successfully flies outdoors video of the robot is Telly operated by an operator but we also have an on-board autopilots as well as the speed of different centuries we can do different controls testing on it as well we also live stream the data from here into a computer ground station so we can we have a traditional tale right now and so those out hotel says elevator pitch in the middle and then for all we can is symmetrically attacking you twin but yeah we don't have a traditional IRA answer control the insight lighting conditions of a robot were able to replicate the same positions that were measured by pennyquick for the gliding pigeons so here you see the comparison for the fully extended Wing are the mid term for the shin voice activation three discrete points that we can also continuously more of just like birds between always positions the choice of a pigeon as a model animal comes from the fact that their parent channel is bird and they're actually like surprisingly good at flying in cold environments in surviving in places you wouldn't expect to survive please find them driving just about anywhere are over 9000 different species of birds and each one has different light adaptation the same bioinspired design rules in order to design that we discovered for a pigeon about another design robots that are more like other species maybe includes annotations perhaps be inspired by the California condor they're really good at lying my towels that are silent flyers barn owl as a case study in order to test the robotic design principles that we found from a pigeon I play the same underactive design by adaptics for the album morphology so it's a different phone shape in a different different size skill so I was a little bit bigger adaptor to use our sellers here we can use the same principle of the same design mechanism indicator wing that came or just a seamlessly as a pigeon design balance things the kinematic measurements in cellar what are the balance with inner wing and then determines can't diving deep into the microstructures to turning with the other services rely they're able to combine those principles from biology to design in Waterford ring feathered robotics putting it all together design we can go from biology to robots by can have another exciting thing inside from robotics be can also learn a lot about biology we can biology inform robotics robots can also help us figure out and answer the questions that we didn't know any biology that we could necessarily test with real animals I like to conclude and also acknowledge my Clara is my resort NG will be Jeffries to say Feliz also PhD advisor David Lynch and also parenting questions what's my precious I think can I have from this design we can also apply different artificial that the manufacturing method so I've actually explored making carbon fibre Feathers and things like that but if you remember the structures of the feathers they have this ability really stiff as well as really soften Natalie against each other and so with carbon fibre rerun until the the problem of them not being able to press against each other because they're too Binfield to cleaning artificial Feathers and there's a lot of things that we can do them play some Pete divers two functions of the structure of the phone the junction of the Bowman also associated with it what's the latest series have gone when too really different how their Halloween they're good at resisting toilet and things like that my reminders look at the different mechanisms in the joints are like a four-bar 64 mechanism to replicate how the bird skeleton moves for mirrors Focus mostly on the feather so I like a simple file the bone into just moving in as a wrist is definite is reckon we can go I think a lot of Engineering materials are good at replicating bone like the 3D printed parts that we have here and it's a small simple structure than the others are Alan the kitchen model detentions did you do in between Fidelis and nps two more secondary Feathers and in this case I use kind of the Pigeon at the template and then adjusted as he went to each one of those elastic bands have like different stiffnesses only different diameters are different thicknesses and so I started with the Pigeon values as a template and then swap them out when it looks like there a gap you're not moving 6 set the second to Sympathy as well and if so inside my that one was so so much more precise mechanical measurements on the h and I think the idea that if we do this really in-depth study on pigeons can we then translate the learning to other species without having to go to these by mechanical measurements and then it is your to do with measurements on pigeons and it is on nails 4 x 6/3 I think it just happens to be more precise in that in that case it could be from the three individuals out initially measured cancel convert 2 m because they use the like 3D printed bone mechanism as well as putting the actual l on the wing itself a little bit heavier in the skeleton section but then since we are using feathers which are really lightweight to be a little bit heavier because the actuation happens directly on the way as opposed to when you have if you slide in Paris coming out naturally provider on Trust for the Rings cos they flap their wings and adding slapping Wynsors like a whole nother mechanism you have to add on top of that and I think eventually it would be something we could do and that's kind of like in the shoulder the power within if you fly think that would be really cold erection a whole nother PhD Project thank you
