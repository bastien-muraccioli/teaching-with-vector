started welcome to ts224 you Harpic is natural language understanding and if you can understand the words that I am saying right now already pretty good at natural language understanding might even be an easy class for you probably have a device in your pocket very good at natural language understanding and that's the problem that we want a taco in this class first let me introduce myself my name is Bill McCartney don't professor in the computer science basically means part-time professor teaching this class for 8 years now but my full-time work is in industry currently I'm in Apple where I hope to read time machine learning organisation I was previously a research scientist at Google and my Focus I Google language understanding for search and for the Google assistant let me also introduce micro instructor crisps ensure that teaching responsibilities today you'll meet me here for me Wednesday crystal take the stage I want to look at is why study natural language understanding what are goals in studying natural language understand possibilities come to mind is that it may yield insights into human cognition human language is phenomenally complex and understanding natural language surprisingly difficult how to enable machines to understand understand how humans understand what's to building a model of a phenomenon in order to understand it better T2 build conversational agents that can provide assistance entertainment or companions want to build a natural language interface to an airline reservation system want to build a toy they can have a conversation with a child you might want to build a virtual companion like in the movie her Arsenal goal is that saving in a lieu would mean solving a major sub problem of artificial intelligence you can't really claim that a system has achieved human-level intelligence if it can't understand language you is a necessary step on a path to strong AI possible motivations I'm curious to hear if you guys have other ideas the motivations that have brought you to this class interested in studying nlu I'm using at Halfords skip song there's been an explosion in the last 4 years of computational social science switch on message to insights into topics that are traditional hairstyles for part of social to go but it's not understanding how humans understand language it's using a tool to study something else I'm here play Russian translation what's the time just wondering many of the goals that NLP has aimed at over the last couple of decades play modest goals so not end it actually understanding language in its fullness but instead ended lower-level tasks tagging tasks for a syntactic analysis racing which is compared to the harder and Higher Level tab 40% play on more about it people get all their memories having some form of understand how to help condition and companionship so that comment was about providing assistance and continue companionship to older people the lives in in the mafia so long going I was going to make an observation force which is the some of those we've talked about our primarily scientific goals is are primarily technological go so maybe number the scientific or number two I will call a technological go trying to create a new piece of technology ambiguous between the two split between scientifical and technological goes is one it's been a part of nlu in fact you see in this quote from James Allen of one of the earliest texts on natural language understanding play to underlying motivations for building a computational Theory all the SIM free build better computers in any solution that works would be acceptable the goal is to build a competition on inner log of the human language processing sys the acceptable only after it had been verified by is when we build a natural language understanding system whether it understands language in the same way that is using similar techniques I didn't scientists then of course we do care technologist then we probably don't read this short paper by Hector leveque for today distinction between scientific and technological growth in some cases you can achieve the technological goals of artificial intelligence does cheap tricks that pejorative term makes it clear that what he cares about are the scientifical snaps to technological goals approach the topic of natural language understanding primarily from the technologist prospect sporty keep this other prospect question for us is what counts as understanding if were building a natural language understanding system exceeded how do we know whether our system truly understands for the years many different criteria have been proposed what is the say that I understand a state in specify it's truth conditions so I'm going to claim to understand a statement like amino acid contains nitrogen I need to be able to stay has to be true glad to be so plausible criterion for understanding rasons about that as a criterion for understand there's lots of other kind of statements they don't really have actions to example of an opinion if I say why did you see Saturday Night Live this weekend best thing I've ever seen meaningful you understand it you understand my meaning specify the truth conditions for that's the funniest thing I ever saw what about this as a criterion of understand argue that I will never understand if I like the most important thing in life conditions for that I wouldn't have the foggiest idea how specify the clean meaning understanding the Criterion is to say that we understand a statement if we can calculate it's entitlements related to the first one but we're shifting our attention Visions of the statement consequences later in the Quarter Wigan look at the task of natural language inference which is one way of operationalizing that criterion possibility is to save that understand a statement is to respond appropriately to take appropriate action service like a rodent for example if you're playing text based adventure game the card game where you want to be able to type commands gold dwarf repeatedly you know if you're talking to your iPhone and you just want to be able to say set an alarm for 9 p.m. right thing does it take the rape act another term for understanding is to understand it's people to translate into another language hi bar leaving not a necessary condition but perhaps a sufficient the natural language understanding system evaluate how are you judge whether it actually turn Direction is going to be one that were going to look at a lot more Australia task for like suggestion is that important test of understanding is the ability to empathize don't know how we would operationalise that as a as a measure of computer understand yeah you related to take appropriate action in light of it or respond appropriately but that's trying to almost played the role of therapist like your chatbot is responding in a way that shows real understanding in real MP that's a pretty high Bar Challenge answer the Lighthouse understand what it means objects interact with one another I'm just going build a graph of Concepts in relationships between understanding in fact one of the topics that we're going to look at this quarter in the topic of relation extraction precisely about taking piece of natural language texts the entities that are mentioned in the text and the relationships between them locations for this is to automatically construct knowledge graphs text on the web sk turnabout Uno back that as certain album came from a certain band and the band originated in a certain city and it got started in a certain year and we can learn all this from temporary roadway review what's a good ideas about a criteria for understand understanding has been at the heart of philosophical debates about artificial intelligence for many years how many people in the remote for my with the Turing test is reassuring I would have been an alarm if it were not a hybrid Chinese rum market any half exposition is essentially a behaviourist the system is intelligent Media is indistinguishable from that of an intelligent human being what is we might say that a system truly understands saves as if it understands behaviour self is enough to demonstrate understanding rebut even if the system behaves as if it understands it might not truly understand ask you to imagine you're locked in a room ask questions in the door respond and passed the answers back out through the slot is that you don't speak any Chinese the wrong with you thousands and thousands of books play inexhaustive detail and algorithm that you can follow to generate the answer play playing the role of a human emulator of a Chinese natural language understanding argument is that by executing this algorithm seed in fooling people outside the room Birthday in Chinese that you don't understand it all behaviour is not proof of understand do you think about this argument do you buy that is it stand up set a free paper or if it's because continues like you always have some tangletree machine set a reminder advert change language to any other computer system sing of the algorithm did you use the first tangled touring play better soon but like me now understanding human separate the album from Tring gives play behaviourist definition of understanding is he's basically saying behaving as if you understand so robust 20 doesn't replace it with any other definition of what constitutes understand turn on home algorithms as humans we extrapolate over skip how do you define humanist trying to supersede the lights are passing you know that we understand human things so I think what you're getting out is human understanding is the way that you understand necessarily can the other kinds of understanding which are not the same as human understanding hello vol it's a nice segway to from the eminent linguist Noam Chomsky he says the question of whether a computer is playing chess or doing long division or translating Chinese is like the question whether robots can murder or airplanes can fly questions of decision not fair whether to adopt a certain metaphoric extension of common usage in fact there's no fact of the matter to debate here question use to talk about it it's just a question of how we choose to use the word more and more people feel comfortable using the word understand about computers it may not be the same as human understanding ok calling it understanding and it's still something which can be valuable and useful leave application the end of recipe for today you have to indulge me for a little bit of philosophy at the beginning of class as an undergrad I was actually a philosophy major so I wait to wax a little philosophical now on turn down from philosophy and here's a nutshell history understanding so in the early days of Computing nlu was precise understanding of human language was seen as a central goal of artificial intelligence optimism to be achieved worsen impressive early successes which which leads to this optimism for example there was a system called Shardlow which was created by Terry winograd who some of you may know is now a professor he wasn't then but he is now professor cured stain due to have a conversation about a simplified black swirl films that were developed at the time tended to be inscope understanding was very brave you said something one way it might understand same thing using slightly different words understand it all 1990s came the so-called statistical revolution in NLP and its bottom important new tools Shimano a general retreat from the higher level in missions natural language understanding and instead the focus shifted Google Tasks like part of speech tagging and syntactic parsing 10 years ago we saw this big Resurgence of interest in natural language understanding leveraging new machine learning techniques and vastly greater computational resources starting about 5 years ago have completely transforms natural language understanding so starting with neural embedding methods like words morning but can I get back together with onto things like lstm and sequence-to-sequence tomatoes and many other flavours trained on vastly larger datasets than had ever been available before let me see this is an incredibly exciting time to be working in natural language understanding is Denis Resurgence of Interest after many years in the wilderness commercial world there's a growing sense that language understanding is on the verge of breaking through as a mainstream technology will last 4 years there's been an explosion of businesses and services that are based on natural language understanding so things the Google assistant and Amazon Alexa Microsoft Cortana and Samsung's Bixby see conversational agents as being a key battleground between the Tech Giants over the coming years let me instead Stainforth grads with expertise in nlu or in very high demand where is the city of York today nlu systems are sometimes in press severe limitations which quickly become apparent show you bunch of examples of those limitations in a few minutes this shows is there any ou is far from a solved problem discoveries waiting to be made scientist in a technology nlu offers this irresistible Christin LU2 domain for it's ready to make a huge impact other hand even they were making rapid progress still doesn't really work yet so there's still a lot of discoveries little waiting to be made you still a lot of gold in the ground that's really exciting what are the most visible in all your applications today is Siri the personal assistant on your iPhone play growing competition is still by far the most used virtual assistant with half a billion secured in 2011 some even described it as representing a breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the next generation of interaction design those claims are just a little bit in Fleet send that Siri has been tremendously impact the last 4 years we've seen Google in Amazon in Microsoft and others develop similar products and add some degree of natural language understanding not only two phones but two watches is an cars and now smart speakers professional agents like Siri work the input modality is speech start with automatic speech recognition probably no accuracy of speech recognition systems has increased dramatically over the last few years thanks for the application of neural networks and deep learning methods you might say the name that natural language understanding play the two Fields have been quite set nlu is usually restricted to understanding of written input that is understanding of text listen some news cases the input is already written or typed skip the automatic speech recognition put aside we often have a text to speech module or TTS modules that's not enjoy you either Nou Camp and and sit in the middle and it's often surprisingly simplest start with pre-processing by some standard NLP tools such as part-of-speech tagging text recognition and resolution the Harvey is an interpreter that generates some kind of meaning representation representation of the semantics of the request representation is passed to a service manager which can make calls to internal and external apis to execute the request what a room for variation here the meaning representation can be discrete or a can be continuous tippler can be manually engineered learn from data is Connolly it's some combination of those two is Corse wall take a look at one of those designs that you really like to be able to have which are just beyond the capabilities of today's conversational agents so whose example dialogue can you say where is black panther playing in Mountain View in the agencies black panther is playing at the century 16 Theatre 5 p.m. went into children for the first show how much would that cost incredibly useful it's also incredibly hard let's take a minute to dissect exactly what makes this hard just on one aspect of understanding here I'm going to focus just on reference resolute Adam of understanding with the various expressions referred to do that we're going to need a bunch of knowledge we're gonna need first of all domain now figure out the black panther refers to a movie Mountain View refers to a Town discourse knowledge because we need to figure out that repenter the first of the century 16 Theatre that refers to the tickets I need broadband you need to understand that by adults and children the user is talking about buying a doll and child tickets and also we need to figure out that the first show p.m. when is before 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. what going on here in what appears to be a relatively simple dialogue there's a lot of different kinds of now winter bear you execute this conversation successfully phone Siri actually does in real life screenshot that I captured last year when black panther came out I'm going to try to recreate the interaction that we had on the previous screen what's the How Siri does with this so I start off by saying where is black panther playing in Mountain View Siri says use black pepper playing at 9 theatres in Mountain View definitely understood what I wanted that's great rather good start quibble that the first result is actually in Saratoga actually no not sure where that is play down to lightning 4506 before we get to one that I'm pretty sure is in Mountain View so trouble about that but I also I think it's a free promising start that rough continue the dialogue from the previous lights I say when is it playing there my question is can I stupid because Siri already gave me the showtimes and I guess I failed to read them or something so ok I'm a bad user on idiot is the Siri or be able to do something use even if I'm an idiot ought to be able to make some sense of this human would be able to make sense of this right if you had a human he will be like oh is a dumb user but I'm going to give me a tour I think you want to be able to interpret that as referring to maybe the first that you gave me show me the give me the showtimes for the AMC ceret movies playing at theatres near you have the feeling that she really understood didn't give me showtimes for the first result didn't give me should I get it did give me some some showtime Siri really understood me it I feel like this conversation is kind of going off the rails and see what happens one adult and two children for the first show how much would that cost I'm just find the script for the previous slide and maybe a minute but I think Siri to be able to interpret this as referring to I mean I said the first show so I guess what's 1 or maybe it's or something tickets and what series to understand that I want to buy some tickets who's the light on in the website ok I'd like one adult and two children for the first show how much would I have a look result about how much I should spend on groceries spell be taken from his parents tired bingo series fallback strategy when stent it has to do something right it can't just like Shannon stacktrace something so Maggi is it takes the last thing it thinks you said and it searches the web for it as a fallback strategy that doesn't seem like the worst idea I'm really not trying to make fun of Siri my point is to illustrate just how hard and how you is play I tried the very same interaction with the Google assistant to any better same kind of I don't need to make fun of fury because people much funnier than me have already done the job when Siri first came out in 2011 play the clip but I put the URL I'm going to post this light so that you can go check it out later if you want to Kabir explains that he's been playing with his new iPhone 4 all day play round 2 raiding the show what Siri to write the show for him because he was magical writing just he says to Siri what would you like to search for I don't want to search for anything I want to write the show searching the web for research for anything I want to write The Shuffle black strategy game of searching the web and again you get the impression that Siri didn't really understand what he was asked please maybe it's forgivable meaning with complex he wasn't just asking to set an alarm but it's kind of interesting to see the same the same for Baxter have this a few minutes later he says for the love of God give me something for the love of God the cameras are on give me something looking for chemist stores or churches very revealing I I think what's happening here is that Siri has like last on two cameras it's like an eagle puppy that just wants to go search the web for you fu blush if I could this product strategy is very reminiscent of Eliza do you guys no Budweiser is this very famous programme from the 1960s it was one of the first programmes that at least appeared natural language understanding chatbot that assumes the role of a psychiatrist the dialogue seems to be surprisingly natural and lifelike somebody really uses so convincing to be alone in the room with a therapy slightly more discriminating Observer you soon realise that it's just reacting to triggers in what you say it's just matching patterns and in transforming the patterns in some way play XX then Eliza says why do you think xx or does it please you to believe that x it does demonstrate at least a little bit of linguistic capabilities so for example it knows how to swap the first and second person reformulating x is Oliver shallowest imitation of understanding is not the real deal actor leveque woodcall a cheap trick vino in lieu has become a major priority at Google it was my Focus when I was a Google and one reason for that is it more more such activity is shifting to mobile devices and more queries are spoken when people talk to their phones they're much more likely to use natural language then when their typing into a search box give me the big push on what's known as conversational search network is understanding the context of the conversation isolated during conversation and you can refer back to stuff that was mentioned earlier Chicago in the you can say still know is that you're talking about the mayor of Chicago you can say how old is he who is he married to Google knows what you're talking about or you can ask about the same Diego Zoo and you can say is it open how far is it it doesn't always work perfectly is remarkably high more it actually works interpretation is not just for natural language also increasingly is that art natural you might call Google lease whether spoken or is because a growing proportion of the query stream is not well serve relational keyword based information retrieval queries are seeking answers that are not found on any web page play Something like how to bike to my office page that is not very web page that I can give more more queries are seeking action rather than infamy text my wife I'm on my way Google responded to queries Like These giving you 10 blue links documents containing those term ok for this one tried it it might work ok for this one definitely not gonna give you a satisfactory result you're really bad user experience enquiries like these requires semitic person which means nothing the query into a structured machine-readable representation of meaning that can be passed to some downstream Compton back and compo examples of w medical presentations might look like here but I'm not gonna dwell on this now will return to in a cup application for nlu is sentiment analysis and growth in this area has been driven by the explosion of user-generated content on the looking at product reviews in social media and trying to understand how people feel about companies and brands and products which specific features of products they like and dislike of startups that are their operating this space and pursuing a variety of different business models so for example there are so-called market Analytics firms analysis on social media and product reviews and then sell the results to help him understand feel about the products apparently if your airline the answer is you with every fibre of their b intriguing application for sentiment analysis has been in quantitative finance yeah but there was a paper that came out a few years ago Queen what is a sentiment on Twitter it moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average 6 days in advance with 87% accuracy sounded pretty awesome pretty exciting so a couple of guys started a headphone to treat this idea massively over oversubscribed a quickly raise 100000000 Mercedes methodology was completely bogus soon had to shut down just because this idea didn't work is nothing there me as it managers are now using natural language understanding techniques in automated trading the shop that are using these techniques are about about how they're doing what they're doing so it's hard to know for sure this is but if you look closely you can see what's of signs of automated trading being driven by text analysis 2-years ago blogger named in mirvish noticed that everytime and Hathaway was in the news there was a jump in the stock price of Berkshire Hathaway company run by Warren Buffett knows for sure but it seems plausible that some automated trading system was confusing the actress with the holding play systems demonstrate very limited understanding this is a fast growing area of these days most trading is automated in most trading strategies rely in part on automated analysis of unstructured and structured data national Irish text that means things like broker reports firings and transcripts of conference calls and social media and so on can make enormous trading profits if you can discover an act on market making news just a little bit faster and more accurately play Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox Trump's summit with Kim using natural language understanding to predict the markets when things go wrong that the use of Nou in automated trading systems becomes most apparent and there was a very interesting example in 2008 why did Airlines stock so what happened is crowd the Florida sun-sentinel website the story about United Airlines filing for serving it up on Google News heating systems begin to react within seconds an Avalanche of stock sales minutes more than a billion dollars in stock market value head evaporate huge Cliff year in this price chart what is the story with six years old it was from 2002 for some reason the newspaper had posted this old story in a popular new sexy date on the article was September 7th 2008 so was the day before this thing happened pointing all around the newspapers should have dated their article properly should have recognised that the story was a duplicate of a story from 6 years old from 6 years ago automated trading systems shouldn't believe everything baby automatic example in 2013 you might remember this one somebody hacked the associated Press Twitter feed explosions at the White House in Obama injured instant pandemonium immediately plans more than 140 points and then recover minutes because save this space this affected the entire market and Manchester single stack impact of it was much bigger the S&P 500 temporary last 136 billion in market capitalisation play Over the came right back up so no big deal right but on the way up were not necessarily the same as the people who sold on the way down there were some huge winners and some huge losses from this event very likely driven by automated trading is a quote from just goes to show you how algorithms read headlines increases automatic order as you don't even have time to read being Mendes economic incentives to improve the accuracy play Billy is Nou systems and banks and Hedge funds are making big investments in this area that was terrible were winter of a bunch of real-world commercial applications of nlu particular emphasis on limitations of Nou there's a lot of stuff still not really possible still goes wrong with anal you represent a big opportunity new discoveries in find better ways of doing applications how we can approach this topic he was a big field that covers many different subtopic so how can we organise the content of the field organised to subtopics it into three levels of meaning so the bottom level we have words and meanings of words and it's the province of semantics next level we can look at how the meanings of words combine games of phrases and clauses in sentences the private of compositional semantics please level we can look at the meaning of language in context and the meaning of dialogues and discourses in topics like reference resolution and pragmatics and so on the Field of mlu is to try to categorise tasks based on the count of output representation that were trying to produce nlu tasks we take a sample of text as input nap it into some kind of representation of mean is an output or as an intermediate step toward a practical goal representations can be continuous or they can be discreet play can be simple timeflex in sentiment analysis where most commonly trying to generate a scalar value indicating positive or negative sense -1 + 1 five star rating system for something like vector space models and meaning that will start looking at on Wednesday represent the meaning of a word or phrase as a point in some high-dimensional space play some prospective is there is some kind of distribution for example a probability distribution track topics continuous representations in representations of meaning for example in relation extraction we're trying to produce instances or database Larry Page founder Google located in mountains the person you're trying to prove semantic representations that can have arbitrary complex logical form Michael Form vets intended to do stay and we'll look at all four kinds of problems appear again and again in this class 1 theme is semantic composition here is how the meanings of bigger pieces like phrases and sentences the meanings of smaller pieces like words within linguistics this question has been a focal point of compositional semantics for decades 16 when we look at symmetric passing in a few weeks cheers as vector space models of meaning have grown in popularity it's also been a lot of interesting work on how to combine vector representations of mean some about 16 is learn how can we build models of somatic semantic interpretation automatically from data for wanting to do this one is a matter of principle of pragmatics the principal reason is it one of the imperious we want to be data driven want to build models that can interpret the language that people actually use which that we emerge reason is the building large complex models by hand expense automate at work so that we can build these models quickly and cheaply the way auto building in 40 different goals for this course that go beyond just covering a material give me the skills and tools that you need to be to quickly apply that you can quickly apply to Nou problems beyond this class in academic research or an internship or jobs in industry the desert does a voracious demand for smart people with knowledge of nlu for you to jump in and be effective wherever you go what is the support you in completing a project that is worth your presentation at a top NLP conference the class will be an independent research project in a final paper NLP conference papers mini cst-24 you papers have actually been turned into conference papers underground or master student or PhD top research conference is one of the best ways to enhance your credentials stop here and I'm going to turn things over to Chris to talk about course legit it's going to take a remaining 20-minutes that we've got horse logistics I want to make sure that you live here with a good sense for how the course will work what kind of work will be doing and sell good way to start with this is to just show you regular assignments I can unfold essentially everything about this course is geared toward giving you hands-on experience with the kinds of models for you to do is take like baseline code we've implemented and take it much for aspected doing is an experience not just listening to us talk about these models and showing off the best results in the field but rather down nitty-gritty actually exploring the code can simulations out and see what how about we do is oriented toward giving you that kind of hands-on when we can see that is the way we structure these for assignment play Leon fold over the first half of the course do you have two weeks cos the start of the quarter is always kind of chaotic but after that they go on a one week cadence Monday to Monday do you want a bra 15 as I said and then weekly after that is an experience what you what you'll do is work inside a Jupiter nope evaluate about the primary thing the only value to explore different kinds of models and the assignment questions are oriented essentially to have you set up some bassline a crucial part of the assignment here is that each one commentator what we call it Bake Off from the few you enter an original sister evaluated on some test data that we're going to provide during the bake score and we're going to give a little bit of extra credit to the the teams that have the top sis the way the assignments work is you set up those basslines then you implement your original system and you get 9 points for doing national point if you just enter the Bake Off I have to do is enter your Monday to Wednesday after this no best practices in the fielders you do all your development and you submit the any more tuning or anything like that you just enter your system into the bake ring systems get a little bit extra credit what we're trying to do here with his assignments and the Bake Off is kind of give you a sense for how we think project shouldn't fall because what we're gonna push for you in the second half of the course is that your project should kind of implement and baseline cyst the original system that tests a hypothesis about how you think push you in that does based something aspect of this is meant to be just kind of reflect back to you which system is 1 which system is really poor to why that happened really interesting cos it's like crowdsourcing lots of different ways that you might approach this problem some good some bad I think we can all learn to do as I said it's kind of exemplified best practices for an all user code that we offer is meant to do that the assignments alright to push you in that direction no if you think we're not living would love to have an exchange with you about how did you better when it comes to best the first half of the course and you'll see that when we look at the webpage you'll see that what we're doing as part of that is introducing what's of topics and they're the topics that we think I was the kind of essence of Nou the ones that if you really master them then you can do pretty much anything we have limited time or hoping that that's that's kind of a generator for you for that Susan Probert here and for the projects and the big boss you can work in teams this is you should form a team on canvas and I've given instructions here you go to the People tab in the groups tab and then you'll have to pick a preselected team from the large number of teams that I created for each one of these a sign tedious but once you from your team that means one of you can submit the work and we'll be you'll get credit sure that if you form the group is associated with it's pretty clear there so the only tedious part is actually forming a group because you have to I could figure actually your work being uploaded to canvas it's just that you'll upload Jupiter now I will take it in a Valley play set it up you'll see that they're called like a sign one big off one time to bake off which disaster 11 for the final price the same to all of them you'll just have to reconstitute your tea it's not the best system but I think if we get used to it all in all the assignments in the Bake Off play Sirens in bigg Boss when we look at the website in a little bit we have slightly different criteria for large teams working on the projects but it's a very soft I don't know what we're hoping that you have an experience of collaborating and you yourself can try lots more models if you were you have the course you'll see this when we look at the schedule like the first half is topics and then the second half is less about topics and more about us trying to help you successfully Audi nlu who is shift how much more about m send text tricks and tips on other best practices things that will help push your is less about introducing new content and more about that kind of methodology in parallel with that of course you're working on your project in as a encourage that to happen is that it kind of the project unfolds over a series of asylum when is a lip review this is just kind of you and your team if you want one getting oriented around my problem you want to solve familiar but we've done it set up an experimental protocol as the second assignment no show you what it what it's contents are when we go to the web page but the idea here is just that were trying to push you to be sure that your project is testing some scientific eye part video presentation typically done poster sessions because it seems like an awful lot of work to create a poster was much smaller back when are you as much as popular we would have people give 3 minutes lots of fun Jennifer little prison I'm too big for that so as a compromise what we've done in recent years is short video put them on YouTuber upload them to Kent but whatever you want to do but the point is that gives us a glimpse of what your project is like and give you a first chance to think about how you want to present find interested to get started here this is a link I will post the slides in a bit later some past projects that are really exceptional from a bunch of different years and front recent years I have some video links available video prison stop that back to the yeah I don't want to make it a formal requirement but one of the the best things that and I'll pay in general and sort of True of all this is how much the community has formed norms around making sure that you open search your problem you don't have resort turn off the other people easily reproduce because when I started out in the field years trying to go down the other people had established in now the pace is picking up just because it's so easy to share the results and that comes back to people ride-away and also open source it would be great to be getting my github links from go follow these links of a second here but something to go to the website famous meander this is going to be hard because of the microphones because the tears were here if you introduce yourself and just said kind of what your interests are in an alu and also if you're an alarm of the course it would be cool to mention the course and personality quiz what's the master student euro r where are we Building Systems to understand search the internet in English and also other languages turn down turn volume down student loan interest is natural minder sorry satellites in Sky what's missing what time introduce what's next the person he's one of the two more or less of virtual ti so he graduated from Stanford the number of years ago is master system work in natural wood understanding social problems returning asep number of you give me able to reach him on video they are also thinking about these alarms and I remember some of their things about this course is that we get a really wide range of projects they cannot go from there like hardcore deep learning things all the way through to do a humanities and Social Science problems and I bet so wonderful at this course to me because like from me as a researcher one of the exciting things I think I can do
