dorsa and this week I'll be putting the state-based models and the Planets for the next couple ba252 tomorrow's and rupees and games and after that Percy will come back review announcements Soho works without the grades for homework 10 be coming out soon alright so so what's up about Stevie smiles search just a start I was thinking maybe we can start with this question if you can so basically let me tell you what the question is and I think about it and then after I get this working so the question is you have a former and a farmer has a cabbage a goat and Wolf is on one side of the river everything is on one side of the river the farmer deformity cabbage and the farmer wants to go to the other side of the river and take everything with them and what the thing is for the boat and then that both can only fit two the former TV unit with one of these the question is how many crossings can the former do to take everything on the other side constrain the constraint as if you move the cabbage and go to forget you if you leave wash the good the work is going steroids how many crossing should you take take everything for you decide think about it talk to your neighbours ironically on the quest play the winter the work as ever can't connect to internet alright so ok so how many figures is 4 Four Crosses 5 7 no solution come back to this question and try to solve it but I think the important points to think about right now is how you went about solving it so so what were you thinking and what was the process that you were thinking when you're trying to solve solve this problem and that is kind of the commonality that search problems have and we want to think about those types of problems it's more challenging to answer the questions and what's a reflex type of questions so that kind of just emoji within that will come back and here is an exclusive basically one with the initial solution is the Farmer takes the good goes to the other side comes back the cabbage goes to the other side and just leave the wolf quiz why we can fly with form if you had before you probably were thinking about this an interesting point in it because sometimes maybe you should change the problem your model is completely what I may be some time to rethink and go back to you and I'll try to fix it but what comebacks so this was a guideline for the class and you've already talked about me for Express tomorrow so we'll talk about machine learning and how do I can get a plane and now you want to start talking about state-based models this week we're going to search problems next week and he pees and then the week after and if you remember no kind of the guideline we had for the class was we were talking about this three different Paradise other modelling ready so in French and worry reflex base models already what will tomorrow be predicted and only talked about and friends with in the case of reflux day tomorrow can you just go bad are you also spent some time talking about the learning so how we use like to try to fit the Prime Minister stop my thing with surgery smiles you want to talk about these three different paradigms that we have in the car and then the planets to talk about model and in France today and then on Wednesday rotacloud are you going to have the same sort of format next week Discovery going to start on Monday Wednesday's are going to be just to give you an idea so what are search problems that start with a few more the wedding example example of finding so you might have a map and you want to go from point a to point B on the map and you have an object if so you want to maybe find a shortest path or the fastest and most senior and that is your picture in the things you can do as you can take it much of actions we can do things like go straight turn left turn right and then the answer for the search problem is going to be asleep if you want to go from A to B with the shortest path the answer that one will give us baby turn right first and then turn left and then right again this is just a canonical example examples so for example you can think of robot robot motion planning so if you have a robot that wants to go from point a to point then don't have different objectives for doing that so again the question might be what is the fastest way of doing it or what is the most energy efficient way of getting a robot to do that or what is the safest way of doing another question if you're interested in is what is the most expressive or right of a way of robot doing it so so people can understand with her about really various types of objectives again for myself the actions that you can take in the case of the robot motion planning is different and each one of the joys can translate and can rotate so translation and rotation or the type of actions that you can take so so in this case I have robot B77 joints and then I need to tell what which one of those joined should do in this is my robot yes alright so so so James is a fun example so you might think about something like Rubik's Cube or the 15 puzzle and again what do you want to do a search for you when you want it and configuration that's desirable in a configuration very had this type of Rubik's Cube or the 15th so that is objective and then the action is it can move pieces around here so so the sequence of actions might be how you're moving these pieces are on to get that particular configuration of the another example of what wishing translation is an interesting one if it's not the most natural thing actually think about it so imagine you have a freezing different language and you want to translate it to English what is the objective here think of your objective I was going to phone English and preserving that is the objective done with having machine and then the type of actions that you're taking is your opinion words you start with there and then your pending rooted and your pending password so so as your pending these different different words those are the actions you can have any complex task and the sequence of actions that you would get to get your objective is going to be the answer for your search for compose it as a search bar what is difference between what's a reflex base models and answer so if you remember reflex day tomorrow the idea was telling input and then he wanted to find this F4 classifier password something like this why Returns label it's a plus one on my head so the common thing in in his reflux base models without putting this one Mabel action being my S10 search salons the ideas I'm giving an employee time giving a state given that I have that state would I want to ask you it is a sequence of but I do want to think about what happens if I take this action like how is that going to the future of search problems that you need to consider future consequences of the actions play Just opening one thing in the night Wrangler what if I actually think about Horizon and I think about how does action is going to affect my future I might call with different sequence ok so anon you already seen this paradigm so let's start talking about modelling and inference doing this so this is the plan for today so we going to talk about the three different algorithms for were doing in French for search problem so so we're going to talk about research which is the most nice thing somebody search problems but the simplest thing we can start with and then after that you want to look at improvements of dad doing dynamic programming difference between a surface problem problem problem doesn't yeah that's true yeah that's a good way so what research let's go back to our favourite ok so the Farmer cabbage so what's think about all possible actions when we have this former cabinet so what things we can do is the Farmer I can go to the other side of the river with the boat so I just trying all here just me the river before we can take the cabbage so see you for cabbages for an Aygo to W4 fault so another possible action is the Farmer tractor cabbage or the Farmers pick the goods ordered and goes to the other side you're so I can come back cabbage on back with the goat I'm basically in Reading all possible actions never do some of these might not be possible in particular States but I'm just creating a library things that are so then we think about this as a church farm on we could create a search which basically starts from an initial state of where things are and then we can kind of think about where we could go from that initial state to the surgery is more of it what is 3 which which allows you to think about what are the possible options that so it looks like it you're selling with your initial state where everything is on my side of the reverse those two lines the river and you can take in One Direction one possible action is you can take the cabbage and go to the other side of the river and and that's not a good state on making at red for like that because of work is going to eat the goat and every action every Crossing with every crossing cost of 100cc on the edge is the cost of so that I really work out I didn't I can you another action I can I can from the initial state I can take the Goat and go to the other side of the river that ends up in this configuration from there the former quid come back pixie cabbage go to the other side this configuration the former can come back that again calibrate state because cabbage and guitar worth on the other side of the river God is going to eat the cab what else can I do the Farmer can come back with the goat what's the formula comes back with the family of the goat takes them off to the other side comes back again so how many steps of the steak will 123456 in the 197 that was the right answer that just because you could have the giant rear go to different so we can actually have a counter that tells you if I visited add state and if you've visited state maybe don't want to go there again this year already explored all the possible you're not done with this tree right like I found this good status but maybe there is a better way of getting I don't know yet I haven't explored everything so so what I can do is I can actually explore all these other things that one could do with them there is another solution and turns out that a solution also takes 7 steps there could be another solution better than so this is how the source tree that's a very good point thank you for that I'll try to repeat the questions I always forget I'll try to repeat the questions the question was whether or the flight are up there so don't matter search frog on so we can try the for my sister so so what's actually think about my Formosa where are the things that we need to keep so we have a start date so as to find a start to be the start state is edition today called actions which returns all possible actions from States action to the find Mercedes me where are the actions I can I don't like any kind of cost function cast button takes estate in action and talking what is the cost of that in this example the cost of crossing over with this one but I imagine having different cost values we can have a successor function that basically places safe and action and until this very end so if I'm state where would I end up and function and then you go to the fine and is in the function and which basically checks if you are an end stage where we don't have any other you can't you can pick up finite state machine type of type of music somewhere type of Formosa 4mbps engaged so it's just good idea to get start state transition play Harry can I say that again an extrovert the action to start from start stage where you haven't taken any actions right and then from that starts date then you can think about all possible so you're in that starts and any possible actions you can current state the base of my current state everything is on one side of the river then after that's like the next action depends on information on the actions in the cost that you could do beforehand how is this conservatory different than like I'm in Costco contact you can think how how is it different from a kind of convex optimisation objective here and then you can think of what adjective is and based on that you can have different methods for solving it right so so you can basically formulate this as an optimisation problem solving look for the solution to search perfectly perfect way of the normal stuff about various types of so what's so this is transportation problem so on ok so basically what we want to do is we have Street blocks from 130 in Vivastreet and what we want to do is we basically want to travel from from 1 to 2 cement number and we have two possible but any States with a answered and any state I can either or what if I were nws walking takes 1-minute I can take a snotty tram and it's not a crime any status 3 if I'm always texting me so if I'm in 20 and I've been 4 up and 5 intend do I have to go actions in any of these and what I want to do is I want to go from 1 to N and then I want to basically do that the shortest time with the least amount of proper so this is kind of like whether such problem is so what we want to do is first stuff you want to just for me and I'm going to do that here I'm not gonna do wipe Solutions I'm not Percy and I did that once and was a disaster we are going to season 2018 make a call sorry going to find the search bar on this tram problem class for transportation problem so go to separate our search Prague algorithms because remember modelling is separate from in French crafter for this transportation problem n blox number Fox so then you have to have a start date for your starting from 11 and then going to the Fighters and so is in state basically checks if you've reached or not we have to get to there the word of doing so we have excessive function we also have a cost function I'm going to put both of them together so the success and cost function and just give it to state and then you have the state it's going to return the triple of action new state give me the state of the initial state and then it just returned all possible actions with the new state I can under pad and how much does what are my options well if I'm I can walk through a spots one that cost 1 if I'm in yes I can take the tram into us and that cost bedtime Reading and I need to check if I don't past and swap just to make sure that you're still and this is what my successor and cost function return Dad so that is my transportation make sure it does the same riots and now I want to print my transportation my successor and returning successor and costs what should I I can have two actions or I can take the tram if I walk if I take the tram is cost to destroyer my I can only do one thing I can walk right because the black is number for axis 10 and I can't go beyond ok so that was stop that was just defining research problem I know haven't told you guys like how to say listen you're just doing mi so just model this Rob on what doing it means what is a reaction to what is the successor function what does it cost function defining is ent I know I think you're ready to think about the algorithms in terms of like going in solving only want to talk about is as backtracking search your deal backtracking search is your study from an initial state and then you have a bunch of possible actions other possible actions two actions possible this can become exponentially but without sound on startup the creative tree and this treehouse on branching Factor number at every stage and then it also has some depth how many levels I know the Solutions down in notes just does the simple sleep and it's going to go all the way down here doesn't go back here and then try again and again and it's going to go over all of them because there might be a person exactly table of start of costs the alarm terms of time the space could you pick another some scores like some of these are so can we talk about that search that is basically this album in that goes to I need a lousy type of I can have I can have any cars I want I'm going so how how bad is this in terms of insurance so in terms of time I'm going over the 434 going over the 43 then than this is going to have this exponential blow up I'm looking at order of again my branching Factor idea in terms of time this is not a good album to go over everything exercise any terms of space in terms of space what I mean I need to figure out what was the what was the sequence of actions I needed to take to get to Samsung my solution is down here my solution is down here then for me but I need to store a bunch of things to know how I got the things I need to store and appearance on the snow that is different in terms of space is all them pigs were there because I dislike the things that I need to store my memory to be able to recover everything as well because that later does require have a ward asleep so the reason I can't forget it it's the only history that I need to keep tracker is this particular I don't need to figure out like I don't need to keep track of like actually the history of all but you're something else like we'll talk about in a few slight you actually need to keep track of the history of get back to that this one with the ideas yeah I want to know how I got there to know how I got like the minimum cost or is it to find Cainer depends on what your objective is so I could really put on what the search for long is asking so so in the case of that farmer gow's example the search for long is asking you want everything to the other side of the river so you have got criteria and you want to find the minimum class 1 so you're sad or criteria so really depends on what the search so let's look at the memory is order.of.the it's actually small does a time this is not a great Talbot them rate post office to the death of 3 is 50 what are the history search algorithms Adrian talk about like they have the same problem so so they pretty much have the same time can't wait to see if you're going to just look at very minimal improvement of them and then after that will talk about dynamic programming in uniform cost what actually was go back to the Tram example I will try to Ryder backtracking search this so tomorrow is the search form of transportation problem could be anything else and now you're going to have this main section with where you're going to put in like Alba something it and you're going to write them as General as possible so so we can appoint them define backtracking search take the search bar can take the transportation problem so and then google to basically bad traffic doing is your reversing and every stage given that you have a history of getting there and the total cost that it took us to two so I just ate having on some history and some accumulated cost to basically requests on that state and look at the children does a reminder to explore the rest of the stuff it's a Halloween you got to make sure yet is the Onion state play the best solution so far what's with Bedford to do so so so the bunch of things and we need to we need to figure out if you're in an entity if you are war update you're not alone States in regard to repair sun later and then in general this recursive function is is going to we're going to call it on on the under start States so it's actually do that so what that I can search this is it caused this recursive function and initial state history of and and custard 0 so far as we have annoying so we started this Thursday we call request on it how do you reverse on children will be defined as the successor and cost function so by calling that's excetera and cost function on a state then we can get action Newstead and we get this triple of action and then you can basically reverse on the new state Nightwing the history you need to keep track of illustrator when the later ones are on basically history is giving track about how you got there and total cost is going to be what you've got so far what's the cost up ok so we need to keep track of the best solution so far I'm just going to find a dictionary here just to make sure that the place we're going to update our best solution so far is that to do that as well in actually and what do we want in the solution vol 10 the costas in Star Trek the cast of infinity and anything the Royal Canin starter start the history of antibiotics definition location of best solution so far then you're going to update that's right if you're on in state if the total costs that we have right now is smaller than the best social so far to update history so what's this make sure that does the thing you Dad we are going to return the best solution so far for now we have defined the transportation from what I want to do is I want to call backtracking search that all sounds good I need to write a print function to be able to print things I'm going to just write a generic print function that you can call the office define a print solution function things to do in London so the solution and unpack the cost and history industry so I can I can use this print solution for pretty much all year talk about how we so now I have my printer function my battery can sort out with them to find my transportation problem I can just call it on this transportation for about 10 blocks as you can see here so the total cost is 6 so what this means is for going from city 12 city city 10 then this is the best solution I got a walk and then after that actually were taking I tried out for a 20 alarm for 1 take the tram and then if it is 100 it's a little bit more interesting if you have 100 so you're walking and then you're taking the tram and get a 24 and you worry have done 1 steps to get to 25 is a good day because then you can smoke so what if I want to try out a much larger number so is it gonna work bedtime was orderby to the date that was a la crate try Dad maximum recruitment traffic your repair try that whiskey no it's just a wine stable alright that was my tracking search so all I was doing with the Rolling over all of this and it was taking exponential time as you saw and you just tried it Dad and a transportation problem you just search problem uses really simple search algorithm so now what we want to do is we want it we want to come up with a few better improvements of this backtracking search again don't get your hopes up it's not Dad give me some something that I'm so so the first improvement they want to make is by using the Sabbath and depth first search Ford F40 the restriction adfs puts in is that your course has too busy so your pass has to be what's the and the restriction is the class so what DFS does is it basically that exactly the same thing is that tracking what was that finds a solution down here when is done basically doesn't like exploring the reason I can do that is the cost of all these agencies the cast of all these edges 0 find a solution I found a solution is that that is good enough for anything like fine also has a cost of 0 so my life so just returned that is if you have Rubik's Rubik's Cube solution and your solution I don't know in different ways of like getting to a solution just one wine I want then you're happy very very slight improvement to backtracking search what happens in terms of in terms of space it's still the same thing so it's order of space nothing has changed pretty good it's order day in terms of time in practice is better right as in practice if I find a solution I can be done don't worry about the rest of the tree but if you want talk about it and see read and the worst case scenario is just trying out all the trees today's forecast in Ireland Order turn down brought a tree stop problems there's a problem you can get to a simply switch the history but I'm saying so you can do some problems overlap you could actually have it and setting a problem that says if I visited the state and so so you have that option or you have the option of going down the tree b critical depth and not trying at everything in the sitting that we have here yeah like you're basically trying out all possible I am talking about the most like general off while you're going over so that was DFS ok jdfs again is you're doing backtracking and then you just stopping when you find a solution because it's costs so in terms of space order in terms of time it's still order that was DFS we have another song called breakfast search this is useful kostas and Constance for it doesn't need to be zero Samsung positive is Aldi's address have the same cast and that cost is Bianca the ideal breakfast search is between you can go layer-by-layer you're not going instead what we can do it you can go layer-by-layer try this later and see if you find a solution here doesn't need to go all the way down you can have with a tree that looks history design YouTube I can have it how to treat that looks like first with breakfast search I'm going to try out this layer see if this if not I'm going to hear you get here find a solution here I know it took to see to get here like two of us if there is any other solution anywhere of this top 3 or in this lottery solutions are going to be worse then like to like Travel hire car because the cost is constant it's useful if your Solutions are somehow like mystery antenna time I get some improvement here because I can call this step Jordan x Marvel Cardiff any terms of time it's still exponential order of B2 the small this is actually a huge improvement because if you think about it the trees exponential-e become lower levels are what are things that you need to express we have like branching factor of 10 the next layer has 100 things in it so going down use layers is actually pretty bad so so the fact that I can improve the timing and then limited to particular depth Reading no explanation do you have that yeah you can see that you're something I don't know just why I know this the best solution I'm dying the problem with breakfast search yeah you're to be all it may be like all the cast of 100 and then somebody unisex border recipe some of the problems the offences in terms of memory in terms of memory you need to actually keep track of the history of all these other all the notes just going to the order of me to the day I have somewhere to the time and the reason is I have explored this guy and then after exploring this guy I need to still have a history of where is going to go because next time Iran in a try the Slayer I need to know everything about this solution because maybe I don't find the solution in this and I need to come down and when I come down I need to know everything I do actually store pretty much like everything about that until I find myself that's you Louis like better research in terms of space it's not symptoms of space it's our direct me to the data what worsen when you in terms of time it is better to start with the shop turn alarm what's up with him what things are not the same as reading a what because it because lower layers are so bad people what do you call the fact that order DFS needs to go all the way down to the floor DFS also saving some time for you I can't get out and then the reason is with the efforts you still need to get to do and that is like that is the place that you're losing still like moving on Tyne and Shirley Kavanagh these are the ones but you've already got to these lower trees like so far that's pretty bad I want to talk about this is an idea tricycle radio actually tries to combined the benefits of the fsm and then this is called DFS what the source of dirt is it basically level by level famous BFF then that way if you find a solution you're done everything is great what what it does for every level it runs a full DFS if you think it's going to take my time because again if you find a solution like early on it doesn't matter that you're ran like so far so it's kind of analogy of it is imagine that you have a dog and a dog is DFS and it's on a leash and you have work shortly and it's going to do adfs and try out and search all the and then you're going to stand Alicia little bit and it's going to do everything and like search everything and do adfs comes back doesn't find anything you can send Alicia again so that's the idea of extending the witches this idea of extending your you're so how does Harris DFS iterative what we looking for on the tree if your solution is like here you're a screw that's worse than dfsr BFF you're doing all these the offences like I hope your face and it's a terrible situation but I get in practice like your hoping the Solutions and solutions are down the tree then you're not problems DFS the question is to be thank you like there are problems that I think this is going to be useful usually you have beautiful the reason I would like there is some structure about the problem that I would think I find my solution earlier so if I if I have some reasons some some reason about the about the structure of the problem and I think solutions are loads in Search of Space so in terms of space it's going to be order of small dinner in terms of space in terms of time gets the same benefits of gets the same benefits of beautiful so so that again like because it's has this BFF the same soul of constraint constant catering that is our table and again and looking at the stable in terms of time you're just not doing wrong smcr and if you could avoid exponential space with you saying something but still this time thing is this and what we want to do it now if you want to search our films that bring down to six panels time to Poole resume magic show Pokémon and dynamic programming is the first give us ideas time in Toronto the Levellers one so was one I'm going to do a full DFS because I'm doing a full DFS in terms of space it's the same as DFS in terms of space I just it's just the same as the length where we find a solution what's the length of the solution is small so now I say levels to I'm going to do a phobia when I do a full DFS then in terms of space I need to I need to just remember my parents so that's why brother p terms of space and in terms of time order of be to the day because if I find my solution here I'm done I don't know that is exponential wireless grammarly pause play hit the Duck and why 5 d x I see why you're saying so so you're saying ok like when I'm doing when I'm performing DFS iterative deepening then I'm doing DF DFS so shirts order BT for each of them but then I don't give them and it feels really weird I should read that here I do agree that is the right time but again I'm like this is so bad that we're just dropping that we don't even worry about that you need to have that extra Chennai gaumont anything larger than over the worst case scenario is O2 Derby dynamic programming ok so what does dynamic programming do maybe I can is this here dynamic programming already seen this in the first lecture is a hemisphere 8S and I want to end up in some and state but you do that an action that takes me to us I can't I can't end up in a spray cost of things I don't know what having some state and what I'm interested in actually computing is for the status define what is Future cost of and that's what I love it is Future I don't know what it is but I can just leave it as future cost so if I want to find a word future cost it is finished Arsenal SA4 what I'm interested in finding is Future what is that let's go to vehicle to this cost of sa status and then forgot hostal sa boss music and I don't know what that is but that's future Dorset from future how do you spell you might ask for what is a where does a come from Iona I'm going to pick in a minimises this song future cost of Us is this going to be a call to minimum of cost of a future customers Prime actions it's going to be 0 if you're in an ent is end already known and stayed in there is no future that's going to be otherwise future courses just going to be cost of going from S to the next day so what is how long would go about formalizing this problem is it I'm going out how do I find with Ace primers I rode the successor and cost function how to find a successor given that we are in status and taking action a crime is just calling access what's go back to some Ralph finding example soto-innes a slightly different refining example so they say that you want to find the minimum cost path from going a City won some city and moving forward can always just moved for work and it cost cij to go from city i2c this is my search for can you hide a tree I want to draw this research for this I can start from city one again another City two or three or 4 where to I can help me 3 or 4 I can have a much larger version of 8 if I'm talking about going to see this 7 then I have this type of tree we're just looking at the street subtrees just repeating the same thing is going to be the same thing throughout and if I use like something might research abuse talk about then I have to go and explore like this whole tree and it's going to be really tank inside here can you show cost the value of future cost where I am right now and because of that maybe I can just store that the first time that a computer cost of 5 and then like in the future I just called that and then I don't like recompute so the other recent here is Future cost only depends on cards in this case is current city and and that status enough for me to computer so sorry for you if you think about what we have talked about so far the stage you think of it as a task sequence of the history of action for this problem just current City because of that you're getting all these exponential savings in time and space because again I can computer cost of five there and collapse that holds three and just go bad solving the scrap that's where you get the savings and it's one of the side again or mummy actually do the key idea here is no magic happening here is it's hard to figure out when you're sick that's important to think about when your status in this case we're the state of summary of all part of house actions that they've taken sufficient for us to choose the optimal future does Netflix have basically word that means is the only reason dynamic programming example we just saw is the state the way you find it is enough for us to Cranford different problem with the state like I defined a stayed in a way that it's not enough for me to plan for future but if I want use in my programming and I got to be smart about choosing my that is the thing that said the site so for example for this problem but I might visit City wand and Sweden 406 and and for solving this particular search from I just need to know that I'm in city living off but like maybe I have some other problem that requires no evil and 34 and and then because of that maybe I need to know the fault this is where the saving comes from like the Yard with the status and and defining so will come back to this notion of state again and think about this little bit more carefully but maybe before that maybe we can just implement dynamic so let's go back to our tram Prague problem and listen for Monday night programming hey so how do we do this you basically just writing that like nice over there and that's all you're doing so so we're going to find a future cost if you're on an n state 0 Martin and Sue you just going to add up what's future cost of S prime how do we get this Prime and then you're doing take the minimum of them over all possible what's future cost of that is lit we are returning that is Future what you doing now in programming do you return futurecast over can you return the history if you want ok so how do I get savings will I go to Prakash right that's the only way I'm going to get saving that is put the cash and and if I if the state is already in the cash or just call my cash otherwise Nottingham Harrogate are we getting so future cost is going to be so you have this function right router crossover steak would you gonna call future cost future cost of nursery is going to be equal to cost of state and actions in this one cost future cost of escrime and is flying comes from this accessory ssrn so I know so so we do the caching the proper caching doing this and now we have dynamic programming so we can basically call this over an problem let's do print solution dynamic programming over a problem you can again play around this thinking I'm taking this if it gives me the same solution tracking search tired turn ideally the same so go back one assumption that we have here to just point out is there swimming at the scrap is going to be so that's that in the sunshine that we need to make when you are solving this dynamic programming problem and the reason is computers future cost right for me to computer cost of the SS prime I need to like have thought about computers are you talked about future customers ordering that exist between my state so if I example where there are cycles then then I'll have that order if I want a computer so I won't go from a to D here and see if I want to compute future cost of I don't really know if I should have computed future costs of or cd4 what order should I have computer play Future Past so you actually need to have some way or doing your state in order to compute the future cost and apply dynamic programming so that's why I can't do I have psycho only think about this you want to talk about uniform cost search what time is the the runtime of this is actually called anything so so what about the status of women right so let's just read what is a sick state is a summary of all class action proficient to choose future actions cancel status what you want to do if you want to figure out how we should define art how will defining state space is the thing that gets the dynamic programming we got it we got to think about how to go back to the 6th apple has changed it so so this is the same example I'm going from city 12 city and I can only move 4 word and it cost the idea to go from my CV out to say dj and I'm going to add a constraint and the constraint is I can't visit throughout series that means on maybe I'm staying one then I went to state three City 123 and then after that can I go to City Centre no I want to find a state space that allows me to keep track of things so I can solve this new search for this new so how should I in the previous problem when we didn't have a cancer Estate was just a currency previously you just caring about the current City and the reason you cared about the current city is like solving the search for my BMW you need to know how I'm going where I should go from 3 so I should have my current problem currency is not enough I actually need to know coming so wanted edition is have a count of how many arts and different first thing I would come to our - something simple so maybe you say will the state is the state previous City possible if I have this guy as my sister enough my current serious 390 my previous city was 1 I know I shouldn't go to 7 but there is a problem with this what is the problem I have anything this right so so currently can take any possible action and impossible previous City can also take and possible options has important I think about the size of my space space what is ent if I decide to choose I'm going to have in school state and remember we're doing programing thing like we need to actually write down my card like had a gift that's going to be but there is an improvement to this and that's improvement that you suggest said which is I don't actually need to have this whole giant previous city which has an r I can just have a counter to just know whether the previous City without that's enough wine or 3 or whatever it like I just here to know it previously was so another option for another option for my state is to know previous coronavirus what do I need to know my current City and this brings down West how does a grin on my face because what was the size of the sky can take and pass 6 if my previous video was on but I just brought down my Fitbit from something I was in squared to 21 and that's a good improvement so in general when you're picking the state spaces you should pick them anymore like sufficient thing for you to make this a summary of all the previous actions and previous things that you need to make future decisions the minimum one because they are restoring this and it would actually matters to pick is the here is an example of like a jacket not so so my state is now the stupid or without the previous it was or not and my current so if I started city one like I have a previous city and Man City won I could go to series 3 and end up in hard and 3 try to go to City 70 that's not possible because like the rest of the tree this is how it's also my steak is a 24-26 play if the previous today is on or even have two options and in my Currency and I have impossible I have enough and have two options here that's why I'm saying my horse takes places to eat ok so let's try this example with not proven just talk to your neighbours about this and then ok so what is the difference if you're travelling from city 12 CDs and then the constraint has changed now we want to visit at least three odds the question is what is the minimum any ideas what is a possible stay don't worry about the minimum why do I need to keep track of number of number what city do I need to just no number what cities coronavirus I also need to have currency right so ok so one possible option for this new example I'm going to write that here I want to list three art cities I also need to know my current City for any of these types at work Nottingham please types of problems but this particular problems that have defined here I need to know where I am so I need to know what my current city is so that is like mystery art series so one hospital option is to just have a camera number of this could be one particular b131 so the question is the series 8 to be different the weather defining the problem is moving forward if I'm in one like I can just go forward I can't like said one or I can't go back so we always moving forward but when we talk about the the state-space you're talking about the more general someone died too and my daddy option at least and then you're done list three arteries that you need at least two are free standing and whatever you for my dinner that's exactly right now I only if I have 4 or 2 days now if I only have one or two Riyadh City so if I had missed then the 6 minutes here is going to be any more transfer a number of cities in France it's going to be a squared over 2 what if I use this new suggestion I don't keep track of 4567 I just keep that one two and three then my state-space and are becoming three times formally write Dad at SCS go to minimum number of art series 3 and then Mr spin then I just brought down n squared to n not also heating option 30 parts 01 so ok so that was look like you can think of your status like 1 2 3 and the series you can think about this later work work it at home but basically your question is again you're going from city 12 and and you want to wizard morat city centre what will be the meeting the summary so far is is that state is going to be a summary of past actions sufficient tattoos future actions after mine and then dynamic programming it's not doing any magic using the snow shops to bring down this exponential timeout and the trick of using the PlayStation and with the Three Horseshoes in the right state and we've talked about programming and how it doesn't work for secret I know you want to spend a bit of time talking about uniform cost search and how that can help me with a psycho dijkstra's algorithm silletts not actually talking Direction here is that when we think about the cost of getting from Stansted to some as prime that is going to be a cold too cost of going from estes frame and then some past Castle alun.wyn dynamic programming make sure this ordering and these things are computed in order so we're not worried about like visiting the state like more uniform Costa through my visit Estate multiple times and you don't know what order to go but the earlier we can go as we can actually computer Pascal as a distance past and basically go over the state based on increasing so windy actually so uniform cost search for the Dozen new estate in an order of increasing so in this case we need to actually making a Samsung here we need to assume that the cost is going to be on I'm making the sunshine so here is an example of uniform cost search running over don't have internet yeah there is a video of uniform cost search running in action and I have time what does about the high level idea Chromecast iPhone cost search we have three sets what is exports which is the states that have found optimal path Estate I reassured like how to get to you have computed the best as possible to get there many have another said called the frontier were the frontier or the States dad via seen you've computer like a cost of getting there like me know somehow how to get there and what would be the cost but you're just not sure about it like you're not sure how is the best way of cancel the frontier you can think of it as a known unknown actually I'm not sure what's up then finally we have this on exports part of state and is unexplored part of say they haven't even seen them yet I don't even know how to get there and you can think of it as more of an unknown play work out an example I'm actually going to do this one so I'm just going to show how uniform cost search runs you're going to keep track of three sets unexplored Frontier so everything is open tonight for the ABC what I want to do is I want to go from a to d that's what I I want to find a minimum password minimum time to get from a to d so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my initial state that I am going to put it on my frontier and it cost 0 to get to starting at that's on my front here in the next step what I'm going to do is I'm going to pop off the thing with the lowest cost from my phone one thing on my Frontier I'm just going to pop off dad one thing off my phone I'm going to put that to explore the cost of getting to 0 and then what I'm going to do is after popping it off from my front serious I'm going to see how I can get from a 2nd order I can get to be an option with the cost of one I can go to ME1 Sky Go I can go to see Miracast so what I just said is I would be from an export to front I know how to get there from me and I moved to Seattle frontier I know what's the next song I'm looking at my front here is not on my frontier anymore it's an export and I'm going to pop up the thing with the best cost of my Frontier so I'm going to move b the best way to get to BRI banana puppy from my frontier I'm going to work hard and see what state I can get to Barbie I can go to a is already next for the best way to get to a no reason to do that Barbie I can get to see if I want to get to see then I can actually get to see the cost of one plus whatever cost of beers already so what I'm going to do with this there is a better way of getting there flights from me and then from me I can get to die I'm going to die from an Explorer the Frontier I can get to it how do I get to from me the cast of 10 opus 100 I'm done exploring everything I can do from going back to my frontier again so these two are not on my front here I just have to see Indian my point here I'm going to pop after staying with the best cars that is so I'm going to move that to explode cost of tooth the best way to get Dad is from Etsy and then you're going to see where we can go from CMC I can go to a will that's done BP already next port don't need to worry about that if I want to get to die from covid-19 so I cannot do this 3 I can update the way to get to the here and then we're done go to frontier the only thing that's left on the front here is I'm going to stop it off nice what I had In Waves so the way to get from a to D is as by taking this rat and it costs 80 that is a clear alright ok so two sides left and a probably can keep yourself safe so I'll do this next time the two slices one is going to the score the pseudocode to take a dad the code is online and there's a small fear and that says this is actually doing the right thing I'll talk about that next time
