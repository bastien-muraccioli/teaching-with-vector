this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development ok let's get started so today video segment is about tactile sensing now I wonder what is difficult about building tactile sense anyone has any idea so what is the problem with building a tactile sensor you just to see the video first so yeah I mean to be able to see you sometimes well yes sometimes you I mean human something is amazing so you have the static information so if you got something now the whole surfaces in contact and you can determine the shape so what does it mean internal for like designing a tactile sense just if you think about the status stop it's on top when you are putting then you need to take this whole information what kind of resolution you need fieldedge you need a lot of pixel spray so how can you take this information and how you determined that information what kind of procedure when there's an element of pressure by how are you the average house so you can imagine maybe sort of resistive or capacitive sensor that will the flat little bit End give you that information how many of those you would need you so how large This Is the End effector time to see if you got that problem you you're going to have a lot of information here and you need to take it back and you have a lot of wires you have a match and you're going to have a lot of basically formation 22 so the design of tactile sensors being this problem of how we can put enough senses and how we can extract this information and back so these guys came up with an interesting idea here it is the light please normal tactile sensor using optical phenomenon was developed in the tactile sensory shown here light is injected at the edge of an optical waveguide made of transparent material and covered by an elastic rubber cover who is Clarence between the cover and the waveguide injected light maintains total internal reflection at the surface of the waveguide and is enclosed within it when an object makes contact with it the rubbercover depresses and touches the waveguide scattered light arises at the point of contact due to the change of the reflection condition search tactile information can be converted into a visual image using this principle prototype finger shaped tactile sensor with a hemispherical surface was developed a CCTV cameras installed inside the waveguide to detect scattered light arising at the contact location on the sensor surface image from the CCTV camera is sent to the computer in the location of the scattered light is determined by the image processing software using this information the average point of contact on the skin surface can be calculated to improve the size and the operational speed of the sensor and miniaturized version was developed hemispherical waveguide with cover the light source infrared LEDs position sensitive detector for converting the location of the optical input into an electric signal any amplifier circuit or integrated in the sensor body the scattered light arising at the point of contact is transmitted to the detector for a bundle of optical fibres by processing the detectors electric signal by computer it is possible to determine the contact location on a sensor surface in 1.5 milliseconds further miniaturization a finger tip diameter of 20 mm has been achieved in the latest version of the tactile sensor is currently planned to install this tactile sensor in robotic hand with the aim of improving its dexterity ok a cool idea because now you're taking this information and trust me taking it into a visual image and transmitting the image and the impact that this was done long time ago I believe 4 the emperor Japan was visiting that love her today and I he saw this quite before starting collection just wanted to remind you that we are going to have to review sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday next and we will again sign up for two groups I hope we will have a balance between those two are coming on Tuesday and Wednesday we will do the finding up next Monday so that's what I'm not here today sure to come on Monday to say alright ok luxury we discussed the control structure we were backing still about 1 degree of freedom and we are going to pursue that discussion with one degree of freedom so we are looking at mobile Davina McCall marvelon a mass moving at some acceleration external doors and controlled by a force app so the control off this robot is dance through this proportional derivative controller involving - KP x-minus x desired and minus kvx so the key is your position game and the TV is your velocity game now if we take this blue control and move it to the lab the closed-loop behaviour is going to be written as the second order equation in this equation we can see that we have sort of mass spring damper system whose rest position is at the desired XV position so Daisy is your velocity game and KP is the position game now if we write this equation by dividing it by M we are going to be able to see what closed loop frequency we have and damping ratio and every time at the Luxor times stop so what is your closer prickles play he is equal 10 and the mass is equal what is the closest free √ 4 and what is the damping ratio little bit more complicated but we can write the same equation in this phone Tuesday double Mega and Omega Square where Omega is your close-up frequency and where zita is disco fishing / 2 square root km and Omega is simply the clothes love frequency √ KP / so you remember this but now the difference with before before we had natural frequency so we were backing about natural frequency a natural damping ratio now this is you again and you are closing the loop so this is your control gain it's the closed loop damping ratio and the closed loop frequency ok so the only difference is instead of a natural system with spring and damper now we are artificially creating frequency through this club or recreating this damping ratio through KV so basically this is what you are going to try to do your going to take your robot you're going to find those against KP and KV and try to control the robot with the skin again thinking about KP and kvk V is f****** said right nkp is also affecting your omega now when you going to control your about what what is the objective what are you going to try to do let's think about it if you'd like to go somewhere right or you're trying to track at surgery so what do you want to achieve with them I'm here is your behaviour what do you what would be good to achieve good cm so we want to have a critically damped system most of the time so we will reach those go position as quickly as possible without oscillation so TV would be selected to achieve that value and for that critically damped system what is the value of data anywhere the numbers it's only two days ago latex equal to for critically damped systems data is equal to uniti one Wednesday days equal to 1 that is when KV is equal to 2 √ KPM you have critically damped sis basically if you know your KP if you're already selected two ok P and if you want critically damped system then immediately you can compute KV from mkp right for that value for sale so basically you are trying to say safe what about Omega so now we need to set KP in order to compute Zeta and how do we set omega someone no idea you go and you want to control it say don't see the counter with if you want with my glasses simulator that doesn't have any sting so here are you games and right now if we ask the robot to so the River Tees flooding and if we have the robot to go to zero position is going to just move and it's moving with that KB = 412 = 40 this all begin with stuff for the rubber but in Factor this is controlled also with Dynamics so we will get to this little later but if we want to to see the control without Dynamics we take the probably non-binary joint control so this so lit loaded Littlewood Exeter can exist a little Horse Outside and see if it can really solid will be too much reduce the gain here so the springers KP is 40 so so now if I play a forest there is a deflection bye and when I'm going to release it's going to go there acelitt little bit tiny bit not too much in fact this has a lot of friction natural friction if we remove the friction and do the same thing it will probably oscillate more not enough ok well restriction the film - how much - 2 this is - 28 think it's unstable wow so so we will see that you're going cannot be negative it will can you stop we need some friction otherwise it will not so so in fact you can see there is a lot of coupling I move just one joint and everything else is moving let's make this game bigger this is joint one so if I bought on join to and release look up drinks City what's happening so there is an inertial coupling coming from joint to on joint just by moving joint to you are affecting joints 3 you can see again join two release engine 3 is moving so in order to avoid that disturbance coming from the dynamic what should we do with baby make it smaller or bigger you're not sure should we trade so let's make it bigger how big 400 ok now you realise with 410 too enough because we need to computer this to make it little bigger so let's make it 20 ok so now what do you expect the disturbance will increase or will be reduced I'm going to release more disturbance or less hey let's what address would left play include is available everyone else ok so this is less it is actually your you're removing little faster and you are you are still oscillating and oscillation is because we don't have enough camping here free increase the damping it will oscillate less and if we increase the gain do you see what is happening now it's going very quickly to it's position so in fact that the coupling this is the degree you look at the 90-degree between join LinkedIn and access three it is maintained Omar in fact if I increase join to as well it will be hard to move it so what is happening now with the with the response do you see the response when we went to 1600 faster or slower slower so so the dynamic response of the closed loop is faster with higher again well then should be inclusive keep increasing I don't know we can try so what is the limit so let's make it 3000 no Gentry is locked it's not living anymore should we make it more ok so what's going to happen it's not working anymore now the problem if this was a real robot 1:50000 work why etc separation of the Motors is one thing but suppose you you have really big mode let me die Santa hairdresser well it's actually what is going to happen is that your remember inside inside structure you have Motors you have transmissions you have gears and all of these are going to move and they have flexibility in this track this flexibility makes it that you start to excite those mode of the flexible system and as you start moving the motor start to vibrate and if you have flexibility in the structure of the structure cell to vibrate and when you hit the frequency of vibration the system all just what are stable so I want to see the escapee that we want dskp we have here this KP cannot go to her we wanted as high as possible to increase what what what is does when KP is high disturbance rejection because Harris coming dynamic coupling coming from other links will be rejected it's stiffer however keepy cannot go too high because Katie is deciding the clothes the prickles and discuss frequency can go as high as those in Marvel flexibility accidentally can not even come close to them we have to stay away from them so Omega cannot be too high which means he can has a limit but we want to achieve the highest skip so what is the relationship between KP KV and dust performance from Dosthill equations we can write BP is an Omega Square and gravy is empty omega right just to writing these two equation ncomputing KV and KP when we are controlling assistant we are going to set what we're going to set the really the Dynamics of the system which means we were we need to set data and Omega so we said and we can compute our KP and KV most of the x 8 is equal to 1 so KV is empty Omega and so all that is left is to set omega so for 400 Omega is equal to what in the case of the former and assimilation we have 400 kg so Omega is equal to turn on the lamp squirrel / is equal to 1 in it's 20 it's 20 x what is the frequency the real frequency so what is your triple see about selective / 620 / 4 it's very low 34 Hz in fact if you're lucky you can go away 210 Hz this would be great so when we go to 1600 this is this is this is really nice 40 / 6 well in practice you start with very low gain induced turning your games up and suddenly you're going to hit noise start to vibrate so go down google.ca some ways of doing this in more precise way again what you are saying here is KP and KV now if we think about two different things wondering that is heavy and wondering that is light my equal one and my call 100 your game Katy is going to be for the same frequency is going to be much much bigger for the bigger link so that game is killed by the mass and because it is killed by the mass we can think about the problem of setting begins for the unit narcissist you remember we said if I'm moving joint to the inertia of going to exchanging big small so we need to be able to somehow account for the fight so I set my frequency I said Omega and said Z and now I computers keepy and TV but then double so I need to update my game right if I went to move with the same closed loop frequency I need some how to update my games and that becomes non-linear control we talk about the unit maths games just imagine that your system this must was unit man eugene's will be simply Omega square and Tuesday to Omega wishes for one this would be too very simple just set omega and you get your KP and keeper ok but we know the system is not going to be unit mass so Ford this in my system what are the games games from this KP plan and key prime what will be KT4 in assistant Matt m using P Prime give you will be in timescape e-prime TV just linear so you take care and you scale your games ok what is the big deal about the scar on packing about the big deal is that my is going to change so even 41 changing mass you can make this non-linear and scale and track a constant frequency and consult damping ratio bed for a system with many degrees of freedom we have a mass match we are going to use the same Council we are going to say I look at the unit mass system and then I scale do you need master system with the mathematics and everything will work exactly in the same way and I will be compensating for the evaluation of the man this is the Narnia dynamic decoupling that we're going to introduce and it is based on the idea that I designed the unit mass system and then I will kill the unit Manchester with the well in this case it is just as a scalar simple Matt so this is what we call the control partitioning if I have a system with a mass m I basically the composite in the mask and the unit Masters so the blue is the unit mass system and my is the scaling of the unit mass so I cannot design a controller for the unit mass system BP prime and keep rhyme and then the KP and KP for the original system will be Justice scaled by that much so here's my controller app I'm going to write as anytime if Prime where if Brown is this wanted ABV controller designed for unit mass so we always do not this as price of caviar so when we say prime we are talking about the unit mathematics the controller Vienna tram system Prime and ask is end times that f cry that will make more sense when we go to the multi degree of freedom controller because I'm becomes the master ok so it's actually we have our initial system that is now controls as a unit mass system scales by the mass itself and the behaviour of the whole system is like this well the dynamic behaviour of the dynamic response and the damping ratio online but we have to be careful about other characteristics like disturbance rejection stiffness they are not and we will see that in a sec the dynamic behaviour of the closed loop is lights you design your controller for the energy mass and basically if you scale with that mass then you have the behaviour of the units ok so in this case what is omega for this system the simply √ KP Ender ok now we are going to introduce one more element we talk about it on Monday and this is just a time in Holland let's funflix so we started with the system without any nonlinearity and now I'm just adding little bit of friction non-linear friction like some stiction on the job so the question chain computer that is it's not living it anymore we cannot talk just treated as a linear system and we have to deal with controller that is going to be in London so how can we deal with ideas how are you you're joined in has a gear with like some can fiction that is so or even know have some gravity or whatever certain type of you can like it change your p value TV if it is linear I think you can in fact into integrated directly in the cave but if it is not linear right just the gravity so what do you do if we have the gravity with the Widow with the Grove Wayne Mardle I know the model because I know the master centre of mass all of these things so if I can marble hearth I can somehow like anticipate what the govt is going to be and try to compass so we can compensate for the gravity if we have a non-linear term what we will do is we that compensation in the controller so now the controller it has Berlin airport which was f-prime how far is Prime prime actually is not a prime and now we are going to add another term beta wish wall attempt to compensate for me you do not know the exact you know sort of model with some estimate of p you don't know x exactly you don't know it's tucked exactly you have estimated what we call It's hard it's not hard and be happy no he has a tractor if it's the gravity it's going to be I don't know ml to sign that angle and you can estimate your my sister mate you're lying to estimated the the position and come up with an estimate of be Wychwood BB hat so in that case you can see how far is simply the ma an estimate of the mass - + 1 grand probably will find it and you'll be heart is going to be an estimate I've been given the state your estimate of the State and you probably have Synapse x little bit tomorrow fair where are fuming that we are going to have some errors bye compensating for the charity estimating the gravity and taking it out later estimating centrifugal coriolis forces and trying to take them out we should be able to bring the closed-loop system closer to a system that is a unit mass cyst with this compensation if everything was perfect we can consider perfectly be then basically beater will take out what is configuration is velocity babe that is exactly compensating for it takes it out and the system is linear right well this will never happen in reality but we will be very close so this is what we can write we can say this is our system and this is the controller standard controller this controller is another controller but it is attempting to render in the closed-loop your system to become decouple linear sister salt here's the result B&B Hertford the hat was perfectly for me and the estimate of the mass metric Slater the smart was identical to m then your system will behave this way so what you design for a prime will be part of the closed loop of the horses we're talking about 20 beautiful but if we are later we will see 20 degree to do the same ok well here is how we can drive this stop I want system was F with the output x x stick basically what we are doing is we are looking at the model of the and we are using x And Explode to estimate b denominators in the cyst and compensate for so f is going to have a component which is BB in addition HR input control wishes if Prime is going to be scaled by an estimate of my the mass of the cyst so bad there is a virtual system here that would look like a unit mass system with an input airprime and this same outfit and this big bear the Red Bar is like a system that is linear weird unit mass and that is the purpose of this design later this will be centrifugal coriolis cavity forces and this would be what Bret the so so in fact with many degrees of freedom we will be able to do the same thing where this becomes the mathematics and here we will have v&g you remember of me Santa football coriolis energy gravity and you can add the reflection as well ok so essentially we are designing a non-linear controller to compensate for centrifugal coriolis gravity and to the couple the system to the couple the Masters inertial forces to achieve a unit mass system behaviour ok so let's see our design for a fine f-prime is in the structure India decouple control structure and if you have a dessert position XD what would be f-prime just a girl position I got position where you have x desire f fine will be miners minus something who remembers I'm sure you'll remember how far is what's 55 x 8 - 62 - key 8 - 60 so - KV primux that - KP prime x - and the clothes that behaviour would be very nice so we linearize this well most of the time you're not just going to ago position most of the time you are tracking a treasure and I'm just rejected me you might have like you might have different accelerations at different point you have four different velocities and whereas in this controller we are just reaching to the goal position Katie Prime is trying to reduce better and give you plan is trying to put the just damping to bring the velocity 2 zip ASDA but if you are tracking at surgery you have all of this design thanks you have deserved position function of time desired velocity and acceleration so we need to design a controller that is more suited for this so What it's prime would be now we forget about the system because we know we can pick up it make it linear let's think about the unit mass system how you would design a unit Manchester controller and then you put it in that track so what is objective you have all this dessert sex what should find b stop you see all the top here is Ephraim I have some dessert acceleration I have my acceleration unit mass acceleration equal f-prime and I know my desert acceleration double duck dessert so if this was really a perfect sister and you are trying to track this acceleration desire what F1 should be ok Google what's so simple that you cannot believe it my system and I know the desired acceleration is double that desire what should find b come off when is the cost of breakfast yeah I think you you went too far as that is that is correct but I'm just saying if if the system was able to respond directly to Efron with no errors nothing and my system is doubled and help the design acceleration double that desire what I would do with a friend make f x equal to right can you use just put a double that equal and everything play the scores and the system should follow if we done this well it's what it will do it because there is really no feedback you have your acceleration and you are saying it's doubled desired this is my train acceleration desire ent as soon as you start the system all stop accumulating errors and it will drift so what should we do we should do the PD part and that's why now we are going to add proportional control to the air the position are as you said - KP Prime X Minus x what about the error in velocity because now I have that desire what would be the term that I should use to follow it design so that would be minus KV can you finish it my Sky next up - x 2 OX16 and Abel the controller this time if I have the photos actually I will from us on the position on the velocity and I would fit forward the acceleration so essentially you are turning the system follow this deterioration is not going the radiators and tightening this earth so the clothes that behaviour is going to be controlling the air in acceleration in velocity and inter I have the photo stick in time and that will basically I call X Minus x deserved the air then I'm really controlling this error as a second order linear right ok no what we have to make sure that we can do this the horrible and we have to make sure that this controller could work with those games that we are trying to achieve end we start analysing the cyst so let's imagine that I designed the system the compensation with the behalf I'm sorry the the they are not appearing as hats but this is B&M heart everything over there then now we are talking about the real sis so when we were running the simulation already we saw lead a small external Force Police service so there are a lot of fun horses coming from the errors in dynamics Eros in the gravity estimates non-linear forces coming from the gears and friction that will affect this behaviour and as we start introducing disturbances in the system we are going to see that these games that we saw I'm going to play a very important role in disturbance research so let's add little bit of disturbance here so if you had some disturbance going to take a very simple type of distance like a bounded disturbed that we are adding from song like type of error in the gravity imagine you have this link and you have little disturbance coming from the Grave so what is the effect of this disturbance on the closed loop map so who is H controller with f-prime skating it by the man estimate and be estimate we are getting this close up so this close look now is going the vehicle not 20 with the disturbance Force it's going to be equal to this disturbance Force divided by em right by the way in some 6 book this is not divided by M it's directly applied it was reply to the decouple unit my sister so because the disturbance is at the end out of the system you have to remember that we are / so this is / ok so let's see what is going to happen to your apps I'm not sure how many of you know we mean by steady state error what does a steady state error what do we mean by steady state yes equilibrium what it's what position is going steady state is like wind acceleration starts the velocity stars and you get your easter position but you are not reaching it exactly there is a small error looks like a spring mass system if you fly little beautiful perturbation with an external Force it's not going to go to the rest position it will be very close but not there and that would be the steady state error so this is what happens when we have velocity and acceleration is equal to 0 and that means the last term jkp Prime is equal to if the students divided by M and that means your hair is going to be the disturbance Force / mkp price again in some textbook there is no my appearing there and this is very important BP Prime is big game the position game for the unit Masters it renders your frequency constant overall the motion when we very m keyprime your frequencies √ KP France however your business your position Gain is m x KP price and if my exchanging your stiffness is very so you do not have come from stiffness over the Workspace as uvaria so you're your steady-state error will vary depending on where you are and how big your hand and you better get a large Katie prime so to guarantee that you have a minimum disturbance rejection so I'm not sure if you you are seeing it Katie is your stiffness is your closed lips Stefan Prime is not mpp France ok so this is very important remember this because we will use it when we go to in degrees of freedom it is the same ok well who is the example I mention earlier if we think about just as the students for this one degree of freedom it's sort of a spring mass and you are applying the service Force and that means the steady-state error X Minus x decide will be given by this equation which miss you are going to this not at XD but as XD Plus this first / the stiffness you so this is your love type ok so the disturbance is going to produce as an error delta x that is given by the disturbance / your sister and this is your m time keeper don't confuse Katie Price for the unit my system and the cape ok now how can you get Radio that era the study Stata yeah I know that's like now you know you don't know I got it hi do you think he didn't see the next no you didn't see it ok why why by adding hi we can we can remove that there Bros large if you haven't saved it turn on correctly adding adding so so essentially the idea is now you're offline will be will include an additional term that magnifies this with some gain and keep magnifying and tidying until you you overcome that the servants now signal action is is very good to reduce errors but you have to be careful about the way you use it better to use close to your goal position not all over especially if you you're moving fast and accelerating winding and unwinding that integral might create and instability so the way you can analyse the decisions is that now you have this equation this closed loop and if you take the derivative of this equation basically you see that now the steady-state is going to be equal to zero so if you build that integral then you will pick the error too actually integral action is very nice when we go to first control we will talk about it later in motion control you have to be very careful about it who is another element of this when we lookout the simulation of the former we are looking from outside let's go a little bit inside and see what has happened tell you have the motor you have IKEA what's a ratio that depends on the diameter of those two fierce RN little or so what is the gear ratio here come on we have a lot of Mechanical Engineers is it big or small typical Gear ratio for for a robot what do you think the ratio for joint to 2 when I moved into here what is the Eurasia batteries mobile actually the greatest for the former Valley between like 50 and 150 summer Robert has 300 year and they have multiples all of the giant cereal like a one two and three have two stages and you get a lot of flexibility little vibrations that appears and all that so it is so it's actually really nice here because we have a very small Gear ratio but I'm not sure if you know what is the gear ratio what is the gear ratio about how how big is Russia 24th no I'm not the weather is doing faster or the link is fast I'm sorry the greatest show is reducing the speed the like is going slower so how slower 1 time to twice please he said like to yeah it is ok so the greatest show is really hard / the other RS Motors I can't say that's your garage end the space the link speed is smaller by that ratio than the speed of the motor drive how about the tour well as it's written so we have a good resource to here the talk as the link is twice as big as the torque at the motor so you take a motor if the greatest show is 1 basically you're have very drive and you need a big motor to produce a talk this big motor is heavy and with the robot putting a heavy motor here is a problem so what do we do you put higher and higher duration reducing the size of the motor and we can achieve the talk because we are using behaviourism no just I wanted to show you this to another it's not about just the speed reduction and torque increase there is another find that comes with the garage when you start moving so we have innocent it's very good this right big and small in swimming now the question is what this motor is going to do to this in the inertia of the link is he there is another energy coming from this rotation of the motor and the cinema is going to be affected by the gate and the effective inertia perceived at this joint is going to be bigger than the link in Russia so what is the effect of the inertia of the rotor that motor day the inertia of the link so they know shall Villa cologne is il the motorist I am what do you expect the real il defective il-2 b so it's going to be equal to il blood something and this something is again you or him ok him twice play the English out of the motor so you mean in general this is end times that inverse of the motor that what you mean that's what it is ending tomorrow which is similar to the top increase the torque app the link is 10 times the torque at the motor you're saying the inertia is the same in the same proportion it is 10 times the talk I mean Danish of them well you're right it is bigger you're right there is an increase by n but it is not linear by anyone can give me a better stomach now you know but today I'm not looking that's why no one is able to tell me so inertia of the motor is there a fractured at the link by it's not at all it's not going to be affected by n because the motor is moving much faster the acceleration at the joint is moving also slower by the data regulation so the effective in Australia affected by the motor is how many times I am Eldon Square much better so you have a British F100 it is big the confession that you are going to carry is really big and that makes the robots very dangerous because the Factor finish that you see at the join is correlated with the impact force that you might produce if you have are a sudden condition and if you are reflecting small initial buy in square of the greatest show you going to produce a large impact Force so here is that this weekend write the dynamic equation on the side of the motor or we can write it on the side of the link and when you write it down the side of the link will see that it's il plus 10 square orator Square I am and this is your factory finish now University finishes always by the square of the garage motor you are using well drive this is really I did we use it with Skara type robux when you do not have to carry the gravity but with Robert that are articulated and that needs to move in space it's very difficult to build robots that have big Motors and can carry distract now variation of the effective inertia makes it that if you have variation of your il il is going to change I am is constant is the same motor so the question is if il is changing what is the effect of that well the effect of that is changing your time response because ukp if you remember it empine ski prime so it's fast directly your omega so you might do an analysis and see if you are using constant games not the best way to select your game is to go to virgin average look at your minimum the minimum value of your il and the maximum value of your il and Take That midriff in genetics and that gives you some ESTA that you can you can use over all the range of Motion ok well I think we are coming to a point where we can break so let me remind you remind you that next Tuesday and Wednesday will have the review sessions and on Monday we will be signing up for those review sessions so please those of you who are not here please make sure you come and sign up see you on Monday
