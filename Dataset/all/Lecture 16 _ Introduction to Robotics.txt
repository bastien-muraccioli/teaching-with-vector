this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development ok well we have a special today this robot is going to show you a video I'm not sure if you're familiar windows anymore do they exist still so the pull my hair is is going to start to the VCR starting and there is a video inside so this video is about a very important aspect of robotics which is compliant you see the sponge is pushing you see no the fraction on the sponge price which means that there is no Force applied here we are coming to a surface that is unknown and the rabbit is sliding over the search so it's making contact at different point if even we remove the whole obviously now here is wavy service that is being followed but just by saying a press down and move to the right cleaning a window without breaking it Ender all of this cannot be done without first control and Compliance so you put an area and still you are doing the same task dealing with uncertainties requires you to be able to control the compliance this is linear complex but we can also do rotational complex 20 mm when your bush the left or to the right you will have a 0 mon Seether so here we are creating a strategy to do face-to-face assembly where the contact forces will drive the robot to move about a rotation centre here and that will result into robust strategy to do face to face without any planning of the treasure from any contact point you rotate minimising this moments of count this is another example Biggin Hall where the forces if contact are driving the motion to rotate and to insert the back into the hall this were developed in the late 80s I mean here is a very nice example with following this racket without any specification just the contact forces are driving this month so voice control is very important not only for compliant motion but when you do cooperation between multiple robot is also the same requirement you need to be able to control internal forces otherwise you will be who does an example of two pumas cooperating to manipulator pipe or I believe we have three poem actually still as we are moving a large object and you can imagine now you are doing internal Force control and resulting force control to clear the compliance how to produce that assembly so you need to control internal forces and there is a model called the virtual linkage model that we developed to allow us capture those variables that you have internal and for the first time we were able to produce forearm manipulation you have 3 and you have the driver and you can see resulting compliant motion and also internal Force control to maintain those contact point and to manipulate this object that we call augmented object all of this issues with recover in advanced robotics later so I'm going to stop here the tape is very long but just thought I'd give you an idea about the issue of compliance so it's just a case of just one degree of freedom you have oh and inner shell some displacement and you have a 4 and we come to this overtime by the coupling the system so if we think about the controller Ephraim to be just a proportional controller so you have you controlling X Y and Z and you have a KP prime KP why prime and kpz so what is the behaviour you you you push here and you're going to feel some stiffness right and the stiffness is going to come from your mass timescape it's the overalls now if I want to do compliance in the I would like to push up the robot and I want the robot to just move with the force and pushing what can we do so if I have a very large BP Z it's going to be very stiff if I reduce KP what is going to happen a pushchair restore a push I reduce it I reduce it it will be a stiffness that is lower and lower and you will you will basically moving Direction price if you make a 0 what's going to happen I'm sorry well if it is 0 it is basically just free now that spring is cut your move it is going to move so from control we develop for the position because we have a control in x y and z in task space at the end of act indicator is stiff in this Direction stuff in the direction in this Direction if you change KP and make it 0 now it's free and just by making KP equal to 0 you are going to have those relations for the first one will be stiff in the Y Direction stiff and hear you just feel the zebra I mean David at the dump ok can we create compliance this way just compliance now it is free but actually what we want to do is not only to create a compliance we want to control the force the contact force or if I'm controlling pushing the robot I would like it to 1904 so when it feels there is any Force motorway which means we need feedback we need A4 sensor and this is really the requirement in order to interact with environment most of the time actually you want to apply a specific force on the and that's requires controller here we have only we just remove the position control from Monday Beautiful One Direction so this compliance along the Z Direction is the first step we substitute with actually this controller in the Z Direction with a first control of later and then we are able to control horses in the Z Direction as we saw earlier and position is in the other direction so this is what we call both motion control together with postcode so this KP pram has a very important role in determining the stiffness but really the closest stiffness remember you have X and Y so this is your clothes lipstick and if you think about it in terms of just the spring you can see that KX is your stuff but now what is the corresponding stiffness in joints you can come see you because This Kiss is the displacing Dr axe and also acts is Jade outertale so UK Theatre the stiffness you have in joint space is UK ex with this transformation so you can't even evaluate you corresponding stiffness in joints note 4 really dealing with the problem first control you need to be able to sense the force and the reason is do you think about the say I would like to control some f desert so let's see if we said to just the dessert first control Force to the desired Force we will we will see that actually the report is not even moving and the reason for that is the friction so if you think about the friction as long as your first design is within breakaway friction you're not going to the tomorrow your your your your first will know get the Robber 2 a beyond that fridge then you have also continuous carnon fiction and you have the viscous friction so it is really difficult to do accurate first control you all the time you are feeling those forces that are coming so you cannot do it in open so what you need to do you need to measure to measure your resultant force at the output so if you're play 1 years and metre in this case that was possible and you really need to to be able to measure the actual f and Formentera between your desire one U2 and your Force actual force and then you can make feedback ent and with a game then you will be able to do a search if you have a sensor then your sensor is going to give you the search for switches the displacement of the sensor a sensor is essentially a stiffness that your default it's relative and the dog that is really tiny so your sensor will give you the information and now you can you can see that what you want is to achieve equal of desire which means that you can select a controller that fit forward the desert for and deals with the era and the feedback through a controller that allows you to control mass that is moving that internal forces now we can then use this relation between x and have and write this equation in term of first control so we can take the second derivative of this in term of forces and then we will have stiffness appearing in the equation and then we closed and once we close the loop we are going to have the responses resource on the that is when we push we will see not only the feet forward but there will be an error coming from the sensor and this error will produce thought to move the robot in away to reduce this error so so if you think about how we can do this basically you have the relation between forces and displacement you take the derivative and then you design a controller like this with our professional term derivative term and then you are able to have a closed loop that minimises this and the response now is enforced Forza Roma I'm not expecting you to understand all these details but it's actually Force control is going to be very very important aspect robot control we just dealt with the motion the question is how we combine the two how we get the robot to apply a force in some Direction while now if you are cleaning a surface you need to be able to move to control directions and also to control the so you have to combine these two and the result is 8 are unification of the control internal motion control voice control nurse together so they are direction of birth control and there are Direction if motion control and these depend on I'm going to skip depend on the relationship between the object you are assembly so if you have a sphere and if you want to put the Sphere on account USA degrees of freedom right you cannot move in the Z Direction you can not move indus Direction you can still slide on the XY plane so how many degrees of freedom of motion you have now imagined in the factories holding this fear on the surface how many degrees of freedom you have five you must do in position and then you still don't rotate you still have those so you was wondering if you don't buy this one contact us how many degrees of freedom wheels here more than one two we'll last the z-axis and we lost the rotation about the y-axis this you cannot read it about this how many wheels 2 you see every time you have a different shaped you are going to lose different number of degrees of freedom hear you lose 3 so what does it mean it means that we really need to evaluate that space where we can move but at the same time did we really lose the degrees of freedom if I'm pushing here or controlling this moment I still can do it I can push with 10 years and 20 Newton I'm just went to the space of first country so indoors contact if you're talking about controlling that variable the force then you didn't lose the dick if you don't when just into the concert and you can control not now that weekend now describe the directions and relationship between the two and separate the spaces in here it's very easy you can say in X and Y there are no rotation about an axis X and Y cannot rotate this about it and what you can read it about see Indesit Direction you cannot move but you can move in X and Y so now the space split into two parts enter speed this face we go to description of the space and we we splitted through this Omega mattress that allow us to produce the motion control in Samsung subspace and the first control in another sub and in this case is very simple what directions you can control forces here the ziggurat so essentially the washing control is in the X and Y and the Z Direction is the compliment if we call Omega bar is the subspace for foreskin so the result is a unified framework what we study so far sort of this loop if I have a motion I can control it and I can go to the transpose and I can compensate for something Google coriolis and do this now that you are doing we are projecting those controls in their spaces and we are doing unified control of Motion enforcer and because we are controlling everything in the dark space so we have emotion f forces we just add them together we have a total for that we transform into ODEON Printworks and that is that is what is nice now you unify all the characters so you can see some long does and some other things that the longer is essentially the most properties it is your Mathematics and x and this is the mass properties that you are using to scale your controller to the couple this and this is done also in the first controller the result is very interesting because you can be couple the two systems in their own subspace and then you can control them properly tell so this is a little bit of maybe the the beginning of the introduction of Advanced topics we will see I'm going to continue with this discussion you have really today with the very important problem if you want your robot to interact with the world you need absolutely to be able to control the contact and contact forces doesn't mean only linear forces that it also means you can throw me and with woman control you are going to be able to achieve a lot of because in any assembly you're going to have some error in the in the relationship between the two how do you deal with this how do you deal with the fact that when you are pushing down you are going to have a moment generator when you can use it the drive well I'm not going to drive it to father build the wall but you can use it to drive this rotation this reaction for sale will rotate if you select this point as a centre of your as your operational tube from Heathrow today this will be you can fix it by controlling this point and now you are rotating about this and we used a lot in doing assemblies between object because we are able than to cope with the errors and uncertainties that we have we know to some extent the relationships but we don't know exactly where things so I'm going to 2 continue with the discussion of Advanced topics and this is part of again attack I gave for recently starts with the window some really old robots I don't know if you you've seen have you seen this Robert Leonardo ok so tell me if you have seen this one can you believe this you have a robot that can draw 1773 unbelievable actually the whole family of robots the draw that play music they can write at that time how can you make robots lives well how do you program the Strava with the technology of the time so so basically you're going to use mechanical devices and if you want to see the computer that was used as the computer so you have Springs and then you have to drive the motion and you can see all this sets of designed trajectories on wish you are moving the different parts so the robot is going to write Jackie what's on my phone so well robotic laws around for a long time right and and really the question was just waiting it was in our minds we weren't wanted to builders machines and the think was just we didn't have the right technology and technology really came much later and brought the first robots that were completely industrial robots that were used in the fractured plan to perform repeat such in automobile industry and others now today robotics has moved and we saw at the beginning of the class that robots are now used or the application of robots is conceived in many domains and especially we see a lot of robotics today in medical apps where robots are coming very close to the human impact inside the body of the human so this is bringing a lot of challenges as we bring robots closer and closer to the humour this is ringing really the real challenge of robotics because robotics in in the industrial setting requires really little from the once we understood the requirement precision repeatability and the performance and speed and robots weekend engineer the machine to do here the problem is we need much more in the robot to deal with many things that are not known in advance you need to perceive the environment quickly respond and react to everything that is happened and you need to be also moving safe so what challenges bring the perception and sensing issues that we need to deal with in an environment that is unstructured and this is really a big challenge and also a good thing for research I mean without this challenge in fact robotics would have become just having the challenge of an structural environment is bringing a lot of interesting issue to the Research instancing and perception in planning and control why planning and control is hard when you have those human like robot what is the problem well I mean in the planning the world is changing all the time and maybe something else you you wanted to measure well the number of degrees of freedom you have Robert with nut 65 and you know her you're talking about many degrees of freedom and you need to reserve and respond in real time and you need endorsements Doha not just moved to a position unit skills Almost Human lights so you are doing anything much more you need to deal with human robot interaction which is going to involve both physical interaction touching the human and working with the human but also the communication the interaction the cabinet aspect and you need to build those and you need to make sure that they are safe you need to make sure that they are capable that's sick so a very important theme in this area is the interactivity the robe also the human friendly design of the robot so that the robot can really be integrated and working with humour tell if we think about this problem and look at the challenges you can see on the left you can see a robot you don't want to be next to I mean it shows it is it a problem underwriter can see a robot you might think well it's smaller I might be so but actually the danger in this robot is hidden inside it's sitting inside and we talked about it in class you remember you remember this in square the English of the motor this is going to be reflected and when you're going to have an impact Force you're going to really produce a large impact Force because you are going to see the inertia of the rotor of the motor so they were a lot of development in the area making robot lighter safer and one of the most beautiful one is you can see it on the top this is the light on from DLR sort of the master in German they have been working in factory had a lot of collaboration with them in designer torque sensors so that we close the look at each of the job and a developed a very nice mechatronic technology that resulted in this very beautiful robot and now you can have complain you can control the robot to be compliant at all the charts there is still a problem defined the open-loop characteristics doesn't have time makes it that you do not have time to close the and there are still open or characteristic that we be reflected during impact which might make the room dangerous so perhaps one of the safest way is to use elasticity with the actuator then when you have an impact the Leicester City take the English well this is not going to to give you the perfume and that is really the problem and the challenge so if we think about the problem of collision we see that is actually you have a robot moving at some speed it has some stiffness the environment have some stiffness and when you have a collision you are going to have an impact typical problem with studying in the automobile industry and they came up with a criteria cold head injury criteria head injury criteria measures the risk of injury given the impact in fact if you think about it in this plane where we are looking at the factory finishes and the stiffness we can see that a puma is sitting here as almost 90% of risk of serious injury and the only way you can make it safe is by like covering it with almost 20 cm of complaint material so I don't know I mean it will be really really big so what is the power I know you have a lot of Mechanical Engineers so they are going to help me now to solve this problem how can we deal with this problem yeah well well actually the sensor idea is really really good but I I I there is no way you can guarantee I mean if you have a robot you can never get Auntie Safety Dance a passive safety that not dependent on a computer or dependent on a controller anything can break how can I guarantee that whatever happened this robot is sick so I I need really need to go for not only to to think about how I can improve the feedback and what we can do with the senses a skin and protection of the robot is good because that is most of the operation that I want also to make sure that if I have an for some reason something wrong the controller the computer something I need to guarantee that the impact force is the law some acceptable so it turned out that a large part of the design comes from that actually and you can see it every time you are trying to manipulate an object with this end how do you movies in the factory unit length and everything we were selling was the carrier of this and affected by to activate your links you need mode and because of the Motors your links becomes bigger and because you put this motor here to carry this and a fact then you need to carried both windmilling with another motor here and you put by the way so everytime you designer about you you're hitting this problem how can I squeeze lighter actuator here the tyre ratio that they reflect the talk you need here is very pretty so you come up with some specific and you see you say I need the 3.7 you will continue stop I thought that you can sustain for long because I'm outside has a picked up that could be produced with in short time and if you keep applying it you will burn your mouth so once you designed your motor and now you can lift the gravity of the link and the Factor and the load and all of that what do you say well my robot has to accelerate has to give me those performance and now my motor I will pick my motor to have those so I need drank to Carrie and I need also the responses they noticed well actually this is what you need unique performances uni but what you are doing here is you pick a motor and then you say this mountain need to be as performance as the acceleration ongoing to produce and this is really not necessary because if you think about the problem in the domain of control and the performance uni the magnitude that you will need at high frequency is much reduced so in fact you requirement are TuneIn lost that low frequency and small talk at higher which means you can design your robot difference you never think about it this weekend design the robot not with one motor but with multiple motor for Easter like human human have multiple muscle actuating and actually differ type of mum so you can please a small motor destruction will be light very safe and you put a big motor at the bay you remove the way but if you do this actually this motor will be reflect and the impact but I said this motor is only needed at low frequency so now I can isolate the motor when I have an impact Force it will go through this elastic so this is the concert with develop dm2 it's called distributed macro Mini actuation that's really is interesting in the sense that you build a robot that has the capacity of a large Rover the safety and performance of a smaller well this concert since when too much further end seeing the performance you can achieve I mean it's amazing you can take the PUMA and build a robot like the promo with 10 time effective in that is you reduce your inertia from 35 to 3.5 and that leads to a large reduction in the initial properties that you see so I think you don't understand this let me show you what I mean play simulator anyone saw the boomer simulator somewhere ok so if we look after the plumber I'm sure if we look at the Puma we can display the initial property of the bum and you can see like you have small in her in this direction and large in Ayrshire in the Direct in fact if I move the promo you can see that this inertia is changing it become here as we have singularity you remember the singularity here and if we look at it in this Direction you cannot move when you come to overhead single and the inertia becomes very very big the goes back to a reasonable value in here so we can take this Mathematics and represented as the national property and describe the properties on the robot so let's go back to so you understand us in Russell property the green one is what you have now you reduce your affected in Russia bye 10 and immediately you improve your control4 so disconcert it's quite complicated because it's requires this elasticity requires the the big motor driver transmissions 22 couple ent we came up with another idea which if we want an elastic actuator why don't we go directly for muscle like actual liking this concept so we started building a robot like this and tidying this robot is that you use bones muscles and air pressure so you are ringing the energy through the air and now you can lift the robot you can produce the largest magnitude of torts need and then you are the small motor on the joint and this motor will allow you to get the Dynamics so from whining the the two you get hybrid actuation that essentially you leads to a safe robot design the problem with this is how can you manage all tubes of hair that are going to go to the choice and control every joint will need to muscles well because I mean you realise you have a large amplifiers pressure regulator and you cannot think just I'm going to take all these tubes you will have a lot of under your arm illegal so the solution to this problem is what is we don't want the tube so we want to put this on the heart Vic so what do you do well make it smaller now what you done to find the right problem make it smaller we can have a solution to this and was Sir a graduate student Nordic the problem they solve it was a piece of cake just making it smaller no problem so making a smaller now you can distribute it and by the super doing it on the links you essentially take one line of pressure running through the Hollow Bar and at each of the joint you are distributing the pressure regulated to the value you need at that so here is the arm the bill endura impact this arm was almost like measure turn light on on so it is really human-like or with the consent of the human in October here are the dimensions well I'm not sure about the the torch and here is the Earth you can hear the air pressure switching and control so now you can the first control with the you control the contact forces and you produce motions with an arm that is writer from the on that we had before 3.5 here we go to 1.5 kg select you go from 3.5 to 1.5 kg maxima you can see on the red response you have the macro just the micro the muscle response is very slow you get almost 0.5 Hz in the close whereas with the macro mini you can go to 35 using proof I think is by adding this tiny motor you are improving the control not only of the overall system that also by thinking about the macro differently and looking at what you are controlling you can also do a lot of improvement what we did we added sensors to measure the tension the actuation using mussels brings a lot of nonlinearities in the Moor if you use a sensor you can close at and you can improve your control so just the macro wooda sensor goes to 7 so this is really really important always to you senses where you can well with the the group of four market we are working out on the next prototype that will come probably in few this prototype is bringing an integration all this Tuesday directly inside the track so this is going to be a colon this is so some of the parts and you can see the overall design so everything is integrated now inside and outside we have skin to protect in the first impact and also to produce feedback so you Italian formation about the contact location so you can control battery euro ok so how many orders we we have today for this one please contact us and send will the alarm sensors on the inside the structure to measure tension on the on the but also we have sensors distributed on the skin outside and that will measure contact with the environment so when you hit first you jumping so you reduce the impact force and also you measure where you are touch ok let's move to another aspect of this human friendly goal and then look at the the planning and control and look after the human robot interaction so let me start with the something that we we basically developed in the early 90s in the mentioned and probably you saw all of you you saw this couple in our lab Romeo and Juliet the two platforms that we used to develop and explore the area of Hulme frenzy robot so it is the video if we can have the Project so the idea is really not think about the problem as well moving the platform stopping manipulating moving again stopping manipulating it is about how you can combine mobility and manipulation in away where you are controlling both so if you're holding an abscess and you have to move because of an off settle you should be able to decouple the two we call this the task and this is the part and we are able to control the whole lobe civitas and also to achieve the posture in a decoupled way so with this you can do a lot of you can clean the carpet open the fridge make a contact control the contact Force this is my shirt I think it's the only served in the world that was ironed by a robot I saw the ad it was Ireland one time this is one of the most complex tasks you can imagine I mean you can immersion internal forces control micromania actuation and cooperation between the two all of this well there was a lot of Marvel's and things we will be discussing in advanced robotics well this was accomplished and demonstrated add to the opening of this building the gates Building and in fact bill Gate when he came to the inauguration he he was quite amused with no trouble wish you can impact also used to interact with the humour so my students used to dance with the strobe another example of how you can interact with them by guiding the motion so the human is is giving the intelligent ask of the Garda and the robot is following and this is this is basically how long is dance ok so by 97 when we accomplish this I don't know if you remember I mentioned by 97-98 there was the Honda robot that brought the first walking Staveley machine and it was remarkable dealt with the Locomotion it didn't radiator dress the problem of many police and since then we had this challenge to bring together manipulation and mobility in the way we did it for my Angela on a more complex robot that involves many degrees of freedom branching structure we're not talking about contact with one in the factors there are many different points you are controlling you have multi-contact you have many constraints you have a lot of things taking place and you really need to deal with all of the simultaneously and in a career in fashion you cannot pull in One Direction without really accounting for what is happening in other day so diarrhoea now of dealing with this problem through inverse kinematic it's crazy because you have a lot of degrees of freedom you do not want to commit your final configuration before moving because there are constraints and joint limits and many things that happened so the oppressed I we discussed in class earlier about task oriented control makes a lot of sense u-pull towards the gold and the configuration in mergers you do not decided head of time and this approach results into a very simple way of controlling the robot directly in the past so in the next 2 minutes I'll show you how we do here but I mean you realise there are a lot of details let's go to the song that's what we studied earlier you have a a force you have the gradient of the four how do I apply for Kiko transpose that that should work we said we cannot just do it like this we need to account for the mass properties we need to establish the model acceleration and Force by having a good estimate of this model we can go and correct this and now we decouple this and we align the Direct to follow the initial prop now the question is if we got to this problem how do you deal with all this point how do you combine how to control this while you're controlling this if you move 11 on everything else is going to move how do you decouple the motion of the right arm from the left arm while balancing and doing all the that is a good idea gyroscopes will give you a good Samsung by integrating you can find the orientation of the you can use that information but how can we deal with with the Prague finding the dynamic equations of assistant like this and controlling we want to use energy but the first we need to get a model of the system for this task and that task and head and delay so we need to extend this operation space control or model not only to find this much properties but I want to find all the mass properties and the coupling between it's not obvious that is really simple so when you run into a problem like this just sit down relax ent and just move back move back from the problem don't go too close to the pub move back when do you see you go to higher dimensions if you got a higher dimensional space everything appears like one point so if we take this problem x1x to explain and put them in higher dimensional space and that's how the mission space they will be appoint a task involving X1 X2 X3 and we are back to the beginning because now with this you can find a jacobian when it once you have a description you find a recording you find your Mathematics and lumberwood end of the day alcohol actually you have the mass properties at each of the point and all day and all you have the coupling between and now your back to this beauty is have the same model in high-dimensional I know you can use this model to control the system is very easy we we use the energy that is we will use force of task to control it with different positive but now suppose I'm controlling the leg end the house but I have all the smoke letters fossil this is the no space motion this is what we will discuss with the redundancy next ent in there you have to guarantee that you control is consistent do not interfere with the first control and to do that you filter it with n the nullspace of the Jacobi and the result is that you guarantee that they would need zero acceleration coming from the control of the past and that means when we move in the personal space this point will be fixed and that is very very important and once you have this decoupling then you can control the system in a very effective so the control of the whole body is past field to control the class austerfield to control the bus and the two of the couple so you can generate emotions without any Project the question is how can we find us emergence how can we find the materials well if we are working with the horses maybe we should look at horses but if we are working with human we should look human like robots we should look at you how you man do it and this is really a good squash I mean we already started to be inspired by the Human the way human model server there the way they move their body and we need to see how all of the can be captured through simple mathematical models that we can use to reproduce the most the starting point would be like just motion capture capture the most and then I'm not going to reply the motion directly because if I record The Motion and replay it then we cannot generally what we what we are after is not a specific match we are after understanding so if you have a system you want to understand what do you do you shake it in define dole the behaviour and you're sick and then you don't fight with the model of that system so you need a model of this I mean it doesn't really interesting Google working with robots and now we are working with human Marvel human model are essentially articulated body systems the mathematics you computed is the same you can use the same mathematics that wishing is different so for the mathematics you cannot take the rigid body part the skeletal model and now anime and this is what you see Factor drop it in the gravity field a pendulum the idea is how can we go from the human do the robots right with less degrees of freedom so we want to see the characteristics of them to see the connectivity of the motion you need to see that situation you cannot do it without asking so we model the muscles and all of this was done with the with people working in biomechanics the group of who provided us with all the data about mussels and end skeletal system telephone mobile what's you have all of this you can start doing the study and analysis and you start to to look at it in try to find what is going on so analyse this when do we start so we can we can say ok let's start at something very simple I'm going to give the human attack wishes like to hold some and the question is where the butter is going to be imagine you are pushing your it was very cold in the morning your car doesn't start I'm going to push your car how do you push the car you put it this way audio Bush appliances the question the answer is obvious actually the child wind at birth didn't know that so little by little you learn you learn and you discover something amazing about about the human body and then you start to use what does it mean is in mechanical structural like this there is a mechanical advent and when you discover the mechanical advantage you start to using so you do not just you the visit by the mechanical advantage you are also using the way you're actuated and your mum the child when he's moving first will all the muscles and it hurt and you have this feedback and little by little you stop to to adjust the motion and move your very correct so human little by little or learning discovering a way to minimise the effort produced by the and this is our speculation research there is muscular effort minimization but it's not always like that it is so there are also a lot of other constraints like much easier to bring the spoon to them to the mouth than the is it to bring the the muscle is found in the response of the mouse and the reason is the reason is Mum this is not polite you can do this you have to do it this so there are a lot of social concerned there are a lot of other constraints physical constraints on the on the system that we need to integrate but essentially you are minimising and if you say I'm amazing that I thought it's very important because now you bring the physiology in tomorrow and you start analysing the physiology and you look a new robot produces a force by applying a charge and positive all of you now a human produce of the dog using another jacou herault transport this is the muscle attachment is called and this are the muscle now if you think about it you are really toned too use this in a way to minimise your muscular but every muscle has a different kapow bigger muscles smaller muscle so you need to account for the capacity of the moose so harissa no our hypothesis we think human or adjusting their posture to minimise muscular so there must be an image ok can I patent we want to find this energy so the muscle is in extension of the muscle detention is minimising the muscle effort the energy is going to be in m square but there is the capacity and what we speculated about is this energy is waited four different muscle with their capacity so here is Danish are you already sitting are you ready want to see it now if you look inside older this is what you see this captures the follow captures your task captures the mechanical advantage of the skeletal system captures the muscle attachment the capacity of your mum a muscle is weak you compensate for if a mussel is missing your compensating for it it separated so impacted to know that student 12 the motion capture lab and we did the analysis and it's amazing actually if you fuel I mean I see you sitting comfortably why don't you just relax your back and and move forward without touching anything with you mist we're going to do to see if it works also with you so let's drink a cup of coffee don't drink it completely just go very close to drinking uncomfortably and like you you're relaxing it's gone look around everyone is doing this not like this not like this it is this angle and this angle correspond in fact too this angle corresponds to the minimum of this energy so it is not the acquaintance in fact if you do this analysis and increase the weight this ankles goes up n you can see hear as you move and increase the weight from 0 to 15 lb for instance this the speculator dangle that you was fine jacket on the body it makes so much sense you are discovering how to use this machine and you are able to use it for the specific in its aftermath and it's not only jacobian that is it's not only the skeletal model it's also the muscle attachment and the way the muscle capacity is the stripper stop with this now we can go and simulator and create so we are doing I'm not sure if you understand this let me you remember I showed you I should just and Bath I think I should write we saw stand out you saw this before right he quickly so we moved to the goal we moved to the gall we moved to the goal and you are able to just check that motion right your number can fall bum is the joint Ltd so now let's go back to this so this is what you're doing we are controlling one point and the body is adjusting it through atria internal space and now you can move it 2 not traduction you're copying but as a criteria that you replied well this is the environment we developed that also contain neuromuscular models that can be used to analyse and look at human this is a recent work on taichi analysis the master here from 18 is performing a motion that we can record and then we can analyse the most and you can you can start to see that well all this mobile can produce amazing things so that essentially you can analyse skills of human you can look at the behaviour of the human centre size it in in fact if you record that motion and if you play it back on the on the physical model of the robot it will fall over because you need control you have errors and unless you control it correctly it's going too far so what we were we are going to show here is half of the body is following the taichi motion and the other half is controlled and in fact you can see that you can achieve those desires have value controlling the robot with other behaviour so all of these are part of the development that is now being implemented on humanoid robotics like Asher and a key aspect of the implementation and this task oriented control is not only just motion and first country how do you deal with conflict how do you die with the Fanta if you have a joint of it and you're moving and you hit a joint of meat what is going to happen so this structure of control that I talked about produces a very useful way to apply constrain essentially I mentioned about constraints in terms of attractive forces repulsive now if you have a contents it has to take the highest priority in the structure of task and postural control we have to urity this task will not interfere with this so if we not a constraint and we know the jacobian of that post then we can know the no space of that constrains then we can take this whole thing in the face of that and then control the cost and now the rabbit is moving and you can see two different passes because you have a live here you are stuck you cannot reach because of gentleman here the body is going to move away La Salle college so the traffic is going through the body and the body will move away automatically by this repulsive obstacles it is very very important to be able to create the interactive video that allow you to avoid collision but at the same time you need to think about the Global not only about the local behaviour we have enemies of freedom the problem is exponential in the number of degrees of freedom you have really 2 to deal with a way of connecting the two and to do that we developed a concept of we call elastic planning which is essentially connect all the plan but I loves you to department in Rialto and by the formings we are able to do a change a feasible plan and adapted to the Reel in van and this is this is an amazing thing because you are able now to be to change a trajectory that requires hours planning if you did use this princess you will have to reply in the whole trajectory with the new obstacles call straight at the same time you are reconstructed because when you are touching operating interacting with surfaces you need to reconstruct the surface 2 and control your robot and that means you need to model contact correctly you need to deal with the contact models also in the control ent this is a very very interesting result that comes directly from control you remember when we talked about pollution is Ashley we are interested in the collision with the motor body system that how can you resolve it well people usually remove the joints resolve the whole multibody free multibody collision and then they put the joint Ltd constraint we are going to be able to reduce the problem to this because we can use the mass matrix in this Direction we can use the factory finish directly the collision doesn't care about what humanoid robot you have you just need to know what Moss Properties you have an account so with this we have a very effective algorithm that I was to simulate and resolve Felicia in real time end with the real-time resolution then you can go and and use it in many different things I believe I showed you this at the beginning of the class but now you understand what what it means we are able to find the properties in impact Force and we are able also to deal with this problem of contact and collision the problem is very difficult because when you are looking at a humanoid robot you just push it and it will tip over it is missing the 6 actuator it's not connected to the ground and you spend your time balancing and if you have any reaction force it will tip it over so the question is how can we move this body while maintaining dealing with those constraints how can you do it well just say it say I need to treat this as constraints what are your concerns this normal take me to k space and take this and put it in and now you know how to do put it in the contacts and then you are able to bring the two together and now this motion will be consistent with the concerns and you can control the forces and the concert if you remember in in the beginning of the class about Omega and Omega bar this will become your Omega bar and this is your maker in the multi contact so that was really are very important result to allows to to implement behaviour with multi-contact and motion Enda now distributing data foot between different services that you are catching moving balancing dealing with dynamic skills it's a directory so then you can start to build behaviour over this that is now the Robert is looking watching it is if there is an obstacle it will move down if there are constraints you are able to deal with the constraints as it moves it is automatically generating the right motions to avoid hurting those constrain as we are building we are moving up and up in the structure so what we really have seen in the class is really the lower level in this system where we are looking at the execution of the motion controllers the first controller that on top of this you can build behaviour that make use of those primitives and you go up to levels well that now you require more obstruction of the sensory information your perception and as you are building a solid Foundation you are going to be able to move higher and higher by integrating also skills and learning from the human hopefully we will be able to get the asemota graduate well I guess so I'm going to stop here end tonight we will see the rest of the group that today we had assertion very nice session we will talk about the final end VOSA who are you want to see tonight well I wish you good put the final in photos I will see with the package in the evening at 7 stop it
