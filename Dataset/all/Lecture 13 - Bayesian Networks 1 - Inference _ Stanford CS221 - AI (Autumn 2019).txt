I'll be back and tell you guys about an hour so before we die then I want to do a few announcements the sport things that should be on your radar so that schedule homework is due tomorrow hope you guys are well aware of that the chorus I meant is released today and will be doing next Tuesday so there's some conceptual challenges here especially if you're not up to speed on your probability the section Thursday while really helping you go that then there is a final project you guys have we all received your feedback of your proposal and are actually making changes so just to make sure that you guys are making progress there is a progress report that is to next Tuesday and this one the guidelines are on the website but it's eyes especially if you didn't managed to get a baseline in Oracle really expect you to have that now and also we expected to have some sort of Premier results with some sort of implementation of your actual procedure algorithm model and definitely some description of what that is as concrete as possible and finally the exam is in about 2 weeks I would start looking at that actually the best way I think to prepare for the exam is to look at the Old exam problems because there is a certain style they have to get used to when taking the exam I know this is a busy time there's a lot of things going on about yeah it's who's there believe that I could be free yeah what day is Tuesday weather the website ok what I'm bored official website ok so the next agenda item is the Pac-Man competition so many of you work hard to submit there is entries into this competition in the end only three could I make it to the top so you're of the winners of the Pac-Man competition is out of town if you guys could come down no replies angry have you got Mrs Pac-Man themed cups filled with candy in case you don't get enough for Halloween so Congratulations you guys want to see a little bit about what was your secret sauce the 4th play Capital change stuff I think different form the listener everything alright so keep it simple I guess it's a battle of Regular programming last week we started talking about Patrick just a quick review what package wraps are tachographs consist of set of the variables could denote colour is a province or locations of objects at different time steps also include which depending on certain sets of variables and these factors are meant to specify or preferences or constraints on what values are good for the variable and the weight of a Simon is the simply the product of all the back so there is a steam that comes out in this class which is iconoclast sa-50 cooling off tonight it's easy to think about how to variables made in Iraq and how you want something local on to happen and these are defined in terms of a factor that is some globally optimal solution so the weight is a global function of all the all the barriers and last time we talked about various different algorithms for finding the maximum weight of a Simon including back just sampling um1 example with locked out was object tracking and in this example we have a set of variables corresponding to the location of a observed a time stab hi and we look at two types of actors that captured where this article the transition factory which captain intuition dad across two successive time stop on just shouldn't if you had help motivation factors incorporate the information from a census at least position who's going to be sun factor that encourages the position to be similar to What a sensory centre Reading and last time we sad this demo where you can define the tachograph quick run and you see all the factors which are represented these are table how many more everything together you get joint assignment to all the variables some number that corresponds to How Great Thou was so far so good and you can with this room where you can do a live with an orb factory Crumlin all the algorithms that we looked at last week what is where is Sacriston how do you come up with Twitter where you can defy me statues if you like it 1 if you don't like philosophically maybe you should be a woman bothered by this because they sack the goal of this luxury and next two will be to give meaning to the Asian Network in one sentence graphs + probably just take it singer stabbed that where have we been in this course this course has been a lot about designing new modelling frameworks look at this which result in search problems and mbps and this was a lot of problems but then we looked at sorry last week cases where maybe the order of actions doesn't matter someone that you want to find some assignment to order permitted the thing about going and that's like you can think about Oceania Lodge analogizer IMO high level language to think about Mars just another 20 ok so that's all with the the basics just a quick review of pomodori usually we've see properly so welcome spaces John correctly to random variable what's that you have yes 109 random variables are things in this example are sunshine and show the variables values are unknown and furthermore there is a probability distribution over all the random variables that catches how they might end no this is called a joint distribution so we're right Dr display corpi of the two animals Snr this is this entire table which specify for every possible Simon to all the variables a single number which is it's so probably that it's sunny and it's not raining I want a distinguished and truth when is our going to use upper case letters to do random variables and lowercase letters to the know the values that the random variable can take an addition I want to point out that when I write p as it goes as articles are what is the expression represents a single number which is a probability sample points what is a variety of Arsenal that expression denotes distribution which is the table these are minor of notation differences but I think it will be a lot of confusion a few kind of the front door joined a solution you can use the lodger probably to drive a several one quantity is called the marginal distribution Anna Marshall this mission you pick a subset of the variables are you can you induce a distribution over that in this case I've picked ass and what I'm saying is I only care about probably up ass I don't care about so I need to take into account where do this is I look at all possible values that asking take on so what in the name look over to the joint distribution and look at all the rows that match that particular so here I'm looking at 0 so that's the first two rows now look at properties in Iceland .2 + 8 is 8 and similarly for Tesco's one I look at all the rose mss1 which is the last and that isn't so what I'm doing here is called marginally martinizing out interesting in the marginal distribution another concert which is going to be really important is the conditional distribution the conditional distribution arises when you're interested when you have an avid assume that a I observed that its rain or equals 1 do I write period as giving articles 1 to say this is the distribution of rias given that it's are ringing how to compute this can I look at this condition or = 1 and I simply select all the rows with match that so the second and fourth rows these are numbers now probably some 21 but what I'm going to do is make them something wine by Norma normalising mean taking are the relevant numbers go into 8.02 dividing by 0.1 which gives me the normalisation fishing point these two contacts are going to be raining pouring and if you remember from last week there we talked about marginalisation and conditioning weather in dyslexia out any questions about basic this is all move on so suppose I have a joint distribution over sensitive variable raining one of the traffic and weather think about this is of as a problem for every possible Simon I have a number that is I'm so I can think of that isn't working this is for sure I don't know what any of these various yes but I know how the Haven I'll be just like I know I don't know what the hell come over the main thing that we're going to do with a joint distribution is called perform problem important thing to no understand because we're going to spend the whole time doing products what is inference the weirdest thing about it is that an observe some evidence you wake up and you see I ok it's it's and I'm and it's a bit earlier so there's traffic outside so are you condition on some evidence = 1 in at what you know and what you like to find out this oracle is you're interested in some set of query very the general form of a promise in French I'm problem or task is probability of sunset of curry bearable condition on Sunset of your conditioning variables Nicolas Dunn another sad there Sunday was which are not mentioned in the Square and those variables are the ones that are more you can think about this query as combining the marginalisation in a condition rhombus cancel this without loss of generality just capture everything that we to do with this sodus point you can actually just do promise I can friends like if I give you a joint distribution which is this huge table with all the probabilities for all the signs go and my computer so now there's a slight problem here which is that if you have any variables and variable takes on true value how many possible how many rows in a table Julian so that exponential that's a lot of it and is 100 m ok we can do this now alright so the first challenges how do you even write down this time description compact what write down to the end numbers probation at work is going to allow us to define joint distribution using the languages because now I have a very compact way of specifying what I'm impressed away something that's very very long the second challenges algorithmic how do you do in we want to do perform inference answering queries like this how do you do this efficient again you want to if you go through to the Ender from hospital because that would be really bright and we'll see that verbal information Gibbs sampling horeca 14 which is the problem all these albums are we are talking about last week or actually going to come into and we're just going to talk about the problematic analogue of as opposed to finding the maximum so now let's try to motivate why we need storm user setting the earthquake earthquakes in blueberries things in a while to bed in supporter independent Academy in your house universe installed alarm system we're just going to detect both earthquakes in alarms one day you wake up and you can alarm go off you should be alive but I'm that there's actually on Earth how does that affect your beliefs about whether there is a burglary ok there's three options increase the probability of a Broadway does a decrease the probably Burghley or does it not change bessel how many of you think that you in other news about the earthquake on radio increases the problem you say increases how many say decrease many of you say a decreases how many say it doesn't what is money ok let's do this question but no people think about that in your back and what day is it unexpected necessarily find the right cancer Cure Just Like Heaven making things that don't leave anything there is actually correct ok so talk about how they go down The Witness 4-step the first step is defining what a variable so what are the variables here ok so there is a burglary an alarm ok Chris things that we don't know about that I mention s start is on you dry some edges going to be directed edges that correspond to notions of info I'm in if you if you want cars cars Allen photos of a butterball news in anyway so what causes what does an alarm for boys the burglaries cause alarm and similar quick has alarm and these two aren't I said it's another directly acyclic graph that shows how all the variables are related search that is you define local conditional distribution I'm going to go one step further and say how these are what a probability of remember I wanted to find a joint distribution of ok so I'm going to find a local conditional distribution for each of these variables here I help you yeah e&co I ain't giving doing general local conditional distribution is p of whatever given so the parents are the variables that directly point he has no parent no in particular what I'm going to do it now let me watch the sound what is PFC 50 is a table that specifies only what's going on in and apv and I just fill out this world possible no 10 what say that polar victorious find generator no too small now because simplicity let's say that earthquake is also at sign in what's this one's a lot more complicated to write the parents by the variable itself now I'm going to list all the possible combinations here 00110011 0101 tiniest pacifier the problem still u00 I should say that this alarm system you but was really good really good so it on so if there's no burglar in earthquake then probably of alarm Markham Yorkshire 1 this is period case which is 0 no problem earthquake alarm and on this is Bali weather a wine 0 so now I can find a local conditional distributions define in the joint distribution I'm just defining in zoom in on a particular variable how does a relate given you have a million local distribution by the only such a night ok so finally the fourth that is to define a joint distribution this is a thing we're all now what is the joint distribution over all the joint distribution is going to be rainy weather Blackwood years on renegade this is the fine to be product of all the local IKEA Vardy plym here Sony reveal the slide which hopefully should have the same content on this I'm watching all of point out is that I'm there is a difference between the small please and these smallpeice or local conditional and these are things that you just define there's no right or wrong there you just defined and then there is this big p which is the joint distribution which is the define just a product and then from this joint distribution you're going to read out things like marginal and conditional look like some of these local distribution right now think about them the question is are we assuming bndr independent an so let's see how do I answer that so yes in this one B&B are and I'll show you all further how we can kind of see them ok dissipation at work what's the connection between this and that well if you are weather what about you see that the right hand side view is the product of and the left-hand side is this kind of joint what is this what's like weight equals so let's go with that an hour what's draw this as a equivalent fraction everyday Now work with actually right as a fact here we have I'm really important to know that how do the factors are arrived do there's a local conditional distribution remember for every day and that is a fact so for every variable there is a fact it's tempting to look at address and rockers Emma one factor of 4 ok so this variable has a factor that is puberty this variable as a factor that's dear this variable has a factor this what is this depending on what is it how many mistake is to just two factors you because destroyed think about it if you think about your your pair weather Meriden actually I'm not making this up but there is some people call this process on neuralizer compute the probability given just so the question is can you use this computer probability of alarm given earthquake alone or Birkdale and the answer is you compute whatever you want and we'll show you how to do that ok single tax reconnect all the payments one Factor variable alright so the joint distribution for all the variables remember is the product of all the local conditional distribution and just for reference this is what it is and now you can no answer questions what is the kind of fun park I'm going to go through the details of how this is done by I'm just going to show you I'm well another definition of alarm network I'm using the same machinery as a factor graph because it is a tachograph first we're going to ask what is the probability of b what is that that says in the absence of any information is there a burglary what do you think that Epsilon Hera 0.04 Andy the probably of a brilliant point BN2 8fr and now I suppose I the lawn winner so now what's a problem what is p of bigger than Oxford Owl set alarm 14 on BBC that probably of burglary given alarm because one is my one the moment truth what happens if we condition on the fact that there is also a nurse so and you get mini viewer cracked when you said that the probability of a earthquake goes down any portable you can think of makes sense from this banana codec in 6 play anywhere anyway happens when you have structures that look like this and you have suppository causes positive influencing after that if you are vehicles from 0 to 1 in a property of a coast and I'm explain waste as a condition on the fact conditioning on 1 cars reduces the probability of the other one so this makes sense because no this is either be or I is either driven by dry and I don't know which one it is have I just heard warm but is very small father has very small probability to the moment I think I kind of neither one of them explain the scores I see that one of them is true then I can revert back to the my probably found humans do this all the time when your reasoning when you think about what causes a new find 11 card and you discount all that that's kind of interesting here is that I did say that be and or which is also true so this might have like people think I've got a change because they're independent so why should you condition I'm here you actually change are the Independence Day does writing things down really precisely is helpful to reconcile these semen contradictory questions about this move on now we talk about the alarm now where this is your offer example of a small basin network I'm hopefully have an idea intuition behind is an ongoing generalized in the dryer edition shouldn't be surprising so in general I have unbranded TV newsreader no text One Direction I'm in Ibiza now works is a director basically graph over these variable Ender finds a joint distribution over all the variables like this One Direction this is defined as a product of local conditional distribution one fridge now the part of our XI given x character by index notation just means the values assigned to the parents of this is a very general primer and just like whatagraph so very you're generous but the key difference from photographs is the fact that these factors on arbitrary there are local conditional distributions what is that mean that means all factors satisfied this proper if you pick up up doctor for the ice no your backside giving experience is equal to 1 you some overall the possible value that excite that's what it means to be a true for every setting of Exeter this probably has to implications which I'll discuss consistency of subdivision of condition and these properties are going to allow us to I'm really you're taking advantage of the problems that structure when we do ok so the first thing is the question is suppose I have this vision at work and on I'm going to opposing interests in the marginal I've only b and ok bye remember this is the joint distribution in Bywater probability I can drive them now the question is what is this model disproved have to do with the baby shower so let's go through the origin so this is a some overall and by definition this is just the product of all the local condition and now I noticed FDM PLC don't depend on which means that I can pull this out and push the summation in exercise and then what is this time this value is just one because of a previous life and now I have clear View hello behold what is what is this this is if you had just gone in define us miniature is in our covered by this was exactly what you that's that's so the general idea here is that when you're marginalising out I'll leave now that you're the busy network is without an marginalisation produces this PlayStation network or are you just a race the variable along with it's incoming Dawn other words I've turned basically what was would have been algebraic operation into a graphical one and generally those are good moves it's much easier to think practically make large operations and go to definition oh yeah so the question is what about this first definition equals what I mean here is why there was a problem no it's not clear definition ultimax ok so I'm no sad in this world en bndr this is one where you can kind of see that actually when you define the joint distribution in a joint distribution two variables bndr the one thing to notice if we look at the factory no which is this thing remember last time we talked about modernisation in then what is that look like what happens if you do modernisation yeah you do remove a but this Factor is doesn't disappear no it doesn't know because that remembered don't know anything about this factor I'm harder than Returns non-negative number so you would have to hold on to this so the moral of the story Fury's Dad if you're using whatagraph you can go to tachograph too early then you might lose out on opportunities Rise simple if you look at this the photograph of this one there is no pee of a giver I'm just to go back here that regret will create a factor which is summation of a p of a given and call Dad and we know because he's arklow conditional distributions as just one that's a first property the summarise if you marginalize out leave no are you get busy at work Robin the second property is consistency of local conditions as I alluded to before if you have p probably be given a MP there's two version are you going my thinking what is the local conditional distribution which is you just define it as such and then there is the corresponding quantity that comes about from problematic info this quantity is derived from taking the definition 1-minute joint distribution and then using the Lhasa probably to derive this particle and this property says that don't worry about it but you are so means that you can kind of that included we think about Sarah Jessica me in 1-hour probably in your head I want to make this explicit by Dad this is that doesn't come for you I'm not going to go through the verification step it's enough now tennis live if so let's do another example just too familiar arceaux so the question here is that suppose you wake up and you are coughing and you have itchy eyes and you're wondering why have a corner do I have the let's follow this four step procedure to define step one what are the variables here Amazon what's 10 + 8 Mam random variables on household connect to sender Asian I should be next to the sea so if you have a cold you probably have I can't turn you tap into your medical knowledge doctor but let's just assume for now that I'm allergies don't worry so just to make a network Sousa now I have to specify local conditional distributions over what is the local remember one for every node yeah CNN probability of a note given it finally I have the joint distribution which is probably FC and this is by definition just the product of I'm gonna go through this find the actual table time but I'm going to do it in this demo so this is a busy no work I just run the poor and this is it's associated remember 1 tax return point switches RCA oh yeah which one accent so I should be like this and then I have to adjust things assisting us CNA world record given piano so this is a factory graph let me show you demo so you can cook on there so you can see is an hour in the photograph answer this question was a question the question was if I have a coffee and have itchy eyes do you have corner so I condition on equals one etsy Isaac was mine asking for you work it out you see that the probability of a call appointment so why is this I guess I didn't tell you enough about have a cold ears 1 A&A probabilities 2 and then there's a kind of noisy or where if you are if you have I'm Accord or allergies and yellow parking if you have are allergies in UK what happens here is that if you if you condition on you're coughing and you have itchy eyes I'm there is a kind of interesting explain away where you even though you didn't observe hey you observed evidence ok and that's enough to kind of lower the probability that this example shows something even more so how information can kind of propagate a long division that work in ways that you can try to do it just time into of the UK my sunrise so far quarrydale so we've introduced patient that works where we have random variables I catch through the state of the world can we have edges between those variables are represented between I'm there Airbus add I'm based on those dependencies we go in to find local conditional distributions you multiply all those local changes to join distribution Now without dry distribution by laws of probability you can go and ask probabilistic inference queries and ask questions about the war I'm giving evidence resigned at this captures interesting reasoning patterns such as explain why finally all this can be bright under the umbrella of the photograph interpretation which will see is a very useful core I'm actually doing probably taking France inter any questions before I'm going to talk about problematic program so this is going to be have a little bit of a whirlwind tour and hopefully give you a different perspective Albany rise to the possibilities of bayesian network what's look at this alarm now again I can write it as on the board on just a product of all the local conditional please basically use now where I can think about this is a problem program so what I'm going to write down is a program dad is very simple program I'm has three lines one for every of the Ribble an resigning as be drawn from bernoulli Epsilon so there's notation just means being set to random value that has a distribution for nowhere insane weather in the finals set a and so the idea here is that I promise it program is just employee programme with Renee miss in it that when you run that's the random variable this is a really useful way to think about bayesian networks Justin Bieber very concrete about this so you can think about the new we of absolon is just a python program that just Returns are true with a probability episode of your renham last Epsilon the random number between 0 and 1 as a problem finding questions about what is why does randomness help the reason is that I'm what is programmed to be would a distribution over possible song everytime I run the program is going to produce a different and the distribution of that sign the distribution the land define does the EU run program write a program with intention of running element to do something new I see the programs are just a cannibal order artefact to define a hopefully this will become a lot better as I go tomorrow can you find turn off TV programme so question is why don't you just so hard to find a table the right instead of writing this program so as not to run this program because not only efficient way to do problems they can print it is more of a i m 40202 help you gem or intuition about pharmacy programs in come back to this one question after I go to a few more here's a more interesting program I'm tracking and definer of program which start with x 0 = 0 and every time step some reading the program in France 2 recorder I'm with probably Alfa I said xxx Apollo 1 - alpha I'm going to so now this programme no Barre just describe I'm in juices a particular bayesian network structure where utsi is only connected to excellent dog I'm trying to get you this think about is there's multiple ways of thinking about the same object when you can kind of internalise all these things you can get a deeper understanding of what we have ok so just for fun you can actually run this product again this is not what you were doing run away but I can run the program ok so every time I enter this gives you a different reactor so this is a way to visualise the distribution over x12s whatever homonym many are red squirrels change Alpha s me distributions which I dispute one side or the other side that's the distribution over as sorry distribution ok so what is product inference work Indesit remember what is propolis inference I'm conditioning on some piece of evidence and I'm asking for the distribution over another Saturday also in case in this case I'm condition on the fact that I spotted the object at a 2 time set time where could have them before so on you're what I'm going to do is I'm going to run the 40 program and I'm only gonna keep those trajectories and show f x 10 = should I do that I'm going to say this is a 2 arm I'm seeing that the set of a possible ejaculation this is the distribution over projector is giving extension I'm trying to get you to think about this patient at work or public programme as what is the distribution you can visualise a distribution by looking at samples because distributions are on how do you actually get a hold of our understand well I'll be the easier easiest ways to draw samples distribution as a question is this way a way of specifying joined it by this I mean I guess you mean that the promise of Iranian general for every policy programme it specifies joint distribution over the random variable x vice versa not working I'm watching out as your hope will become clearer Dad the reason to think about in terms of programs that you can inherit all the nice properties of function door even have recursion you could do a lot more arm accounting software programs that you can do with which should be hard another way to think about it ok you're basically writing sound every variable use pacifier but if you have a million out of variables sometimes it's useful to be able to structure your recordings what was that over the neck ok so this is going to be a martyr I think around 7 possible also possible examples and just want to give you a flavour of types of problems for programmers the first one is called Justin Mark whenever program generalisation marshmallow I'm so this has a lot of applications in your mother in language of Time series and the program works as follows for every position I threw an I'm going to generate a particular a word excite given the previous this is also happened to be the same type of program as for the object tracking the decision out and here's another one this is called a hidden Markov model which is you're a very popular old hours uses for marketing backseat recognition Motorpoint before you're the rise of concern so the idea here is that for every time step to 12th I'm going to generate an object with location HT given the previous HD - 1 Birds the reason why it's called a hidden Markov models that I'm not actually going to observe HT I'm going observe sensor readings ET Alice X ft giving are the hidden location so this is what hero marshmallow looks like sensor readings which I do abs Japan respectively on the call location just as a convention whenever I shoot a very bored I mean this program defines a joint distribution over all the variables and now you can ask are particular questions you can do problems again and the mo common saying that people do here is giving the sensor readings where is Assad which is something we've already been exposed to through the lens of package but this is again away to think about it so now with this kind of problem before you can actually do more complications in a very account I'm motor water tracking you can think about are there been two objects a and b and you position it is time step and every object I'm going to generate a location for that and this is going to be too independent above the thing is at least I'm only observed one sensory that sounds everything is going to be some combination sum function of the actual location for the hopefully you can see a little bit of advantage of thinking in terms of a program because I can write this kind of very simple for line programs I'm very precisely nails down I'm in particular this factorio itching is it something that you going to be here's another example This Is 40 usually used for car classifications called and the program looks like this you first Jenna label y that supposed during travel and now you're going to every word in your document you going to generate a word Stephen dillane so if you generate generate water cycling so now the that again specify the distribution of all of the Ramones what do you typically interested in you be interesting classification you're giving the words I know you want to go back in figure out what the Carson's give me a text document what is use of fancy a model of documents called reindeers allocation instead of have generator single topic I'm going to generate a distribution of 8 because this random variable itself is actually this that worry too much about this is a distribution and for every position and going to first general atopy light travel organ and then for that a topic I'm going to generate a word given that this allows you to model documents which talk about multiple things for example travel in this is also very popular model that can be used to you give me an article of documents try to understand understand structuring so here is one that's kind of generalization of the the medical diagnostics on example general letter you have a bunch of diseases you generate the activity of a particular disease in a patient according to some you're prior distribution and now you've every symptom that you might observe or any sort of laptop you have the probability of song how come is that symptom giving the Promise inference question Theory if a patient has a particular a symptoms what eye diseases are there where problem says I think maybe the final example who's the social network analysis example where you have an a set of people this person has on your quarter type scientist and display every pair of people they can either interact or not they might be connected or not the social Ansell in the hand what your giving is a social network of our connectivity in your ass what kind of types of people are there generally you you observed my SoundCloud and you want to understand what kind of feature is or what is what is a country way of summarising the types there's a disco Lusso classic black model so that was a very quick overview of different types of property programmes evasion networks and the point is that the many many different types of moles I can be written down in the lyrics many things Jeremy candy just ring down inner product program I'm Oldham kind of have this kind of basic structure you observe carefully all them kind of work like that where is their son set a variable age Richard Oliver that generates or causes I said a variable Z which you do answer so the myself when you design vision that works you're coming up with stories of how the data would you what you observed was generated through the quantities of intra Alpha no this is proper maybe counterintuitive for those of you who are really used to thinking about just normal classification with its opposite you still with the import and you think about what he things to do today in Puerto Rico I've what kind of things can I do to get it to the point where I can classify unemployed precisely provisional was cancelled office it it starts with Alfred or the structures interested in which are resume that have more on powerful tonic ID or something cleaner and then you're trying to describe how the Queen gives rise to this kind of messy sorry the clean structure gives rise to the messy data that right so why is the this called the Alps I'm using input-output here and it's a ball terminology for when we talk about classification where you going from import if it is why you are given and Alfred is what year The Division network the first to find the model of going from output to input opposite of what you normally do now now there's a second stage where you deposit in France which reverses that can you go from the observations which are the input to the output questions about Direct so now let's talk about him France this is also going to be the topic of next lecture but I'm just going to start play around with this remember what is policy in France Give Me a Reason at work what's a gibbon song setting of the variables which is evidence turn off and I'm interested in a subset of variables hey so what I'm trying to produce is probability of Sum query variables condition evidence what does ruin mean as I want is for all values of affordable about coughing and itchy eyes provident ok so what's wrong with this simple example suppose this Markov model in a access query what is the probability of x 7 x 2 = Disney XD no I just want you already have the tours to do that show you how you can just arm go to the calculation and then I'm going to show you so if you worm just show this way now this is probably what you would do which might be Liberty yes bylaws a probability that this conditioning is equal to the joint over this just by definition of conditional probability end one thing I'm going to do here is on noticed Dad I'm only interested in this region from that perspective this what denominator is it doesn't depend on next I'm going to write is this proportional to which means that the actual value here is this thing on the right hand side and the reason I can do this and I don't care about is because I know that and distribution what have I got on the right hand side if it's under 6 or something that I just / this is going to save you a lot of work if you use a proportional to but you have to use a careful otherwise you can get wrong what's expanded so this is a marginal distribution of x to x I'm I can write in terms of the joint where are some of the variables that are there's a game and then the definition of the bayesian networks here is a joint distribution is equal to the product of local conditional distribution right now I have a lower I'm now I'm going to do some algebraic manipulation so noticed that this stuff doesn't depend on Explorer so I can push the summation next for over here and then these two first two terms arm are the first two terms of the next one so I can route lesson Abba song over x 105 and then I can look up here and you what is the sum 2 one drop it and then what is this the pain on extreme so I can also drop that and I get a PO Box Regan hopefully shouldn't be surprising to anyone because remember that's why when I said I like consistency this this should be equal to just one Wi-Fi I'm so no this was you can do that I mean this one is actually not that especially when you're in a answering but I promise you there were going to be situations where you definitely don't want to temperature equation I'm going to show you the way to do this start this is going to be a 5 Step procedure but it make it is on all the steps are necessary and the key ideas going to be to use the Rodger of the bayesian network Antarctica you simplify some of these so let's start with an actual 3 at 4 so and I'm conditioning activate so I'm interested in this song the first thing I want to do is I want to remove as many because that's going to simplify I'm going to or Martin R9 go bananas series Amy stream I am going to keep her now anything that stands so what can I remove X4 Wokingham graphically just remove x in response to on the slide basically the fact that this thing song what I've done this again graphically the population Twitter so the second Step is I'm going to convert tachograph arm because one already take care of exploring the proper Stretton wi I don't simple to think about is a fact where I want to think about are the factors more explicitly just arbitrary functions and not worry about which way they can does it really easy I'm busy now about what you're wondering like condition what's a marginal distribution knackered by actually removing the direction ideas Maddox actually so I'm going to which means I have an just drive down here who is the factor graph remember I have a holiday are there any of you giving it 1 this might look like and more work right now because I'm making every variable has no now I want to condition I'm under so I'm conditioner next to good 5 remember what the condition indoors remember from last week's lottery listen just removes this and changes the factors to except to the value yeah we should have it the soccer show the Explorer this is a factor graph course and ok so I'm conditioner next to so white actor from the face of the Earth I'm going to factor 2 partial evaluation of where I put zakaria excuse because this connection is so now I on marginalised disconnected components and these are components this top is disconnected so I don't care about it so I'm just going to that operation corresponds to the fact that you're this thing over here I just can't talk because it's not really ok so finally the first step is actually are work so what is that mean arm likely to be last with just single barrel with the back hair where is the word in that case you'll actually have to YouTube patient operation last in this case we are fortunate that this Dr does Ashley Roberts and the distribution of X3 so that is so this is just a general strategy that again I think once you get I'm good at this you can basically 1 and he had a very visual because you can just cry or everything downstream just doesn't matter and when you see these these are conditioning things you can kind of I'm actually just ignore just jumped that's just doing things a more explicit on the board so I'm going to do another example is a lion so here I have this vision at work and I'm probably start with 19 which are the na na A&E I just remove them from a piece of that and I'm just left with this singer and it has a tracker so this one's all maybe a little bit more you're complicated so this is probably given = 1 so what score through the 6 apple I have Salman answer so what I mean interested in a problem audio missile GMB that caramel so what are the non answer service of the variable so this is an ancestor of a my there 30 Factor graph we've done this before what is a product and then this condition on Venus now I condition on a equal so I'm going to remove change the SATA to equals one WhatsApp is Marshall eyes out anything that disconnected rather have to be right ok so what is actual work mean Tristan the problem be do I need a margin like that how to do this kind of hard drive micro so do here what happens when I create a new Factor using new factor of SSP and which is the mortar and this is going to be the product of all the doctors here touch this variable than Martin rising out and the only difference between this and what were doing last time as before we had a Max because we're doing Macklemore Otherside ensure I'm going to have a son because and then a final query is going to be just a product of those I'm not going to have time to actually drill down into Stanley I'm back if you actually plug in absalom's into this Daniel find that probability 1 event wine 1/2 - 1 which is remember .5 wine Borat but this calculation you can look into a fly ok there's another example which I'm going to defer to section acaba I think it in all this you just need to do some practical get comfortable doing his operation to summarise define bayesian network are there whales defining models that I'm allowed to specify local Artemis global want to have a busy now I can do problem you can have an answer query variables of interest and next time we're going to focus on number five and hopefully not too things completely manually but
