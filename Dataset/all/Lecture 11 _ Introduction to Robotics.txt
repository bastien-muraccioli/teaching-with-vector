this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development alright let's get started so the video segment today is quite interesting it was presented after the 2000 international conference on robotics and automation Endor I'm sure you're going to like robotic reconnaissance and surveillance team USA heterogeneous multi-robot system for surveillance and exploration tasks at the first year of his team is discount scouter small mobile sensor platforms used in a cooperating group at the second tier is the ranger Rangers are larger robots used to transport deploy and coordinator Scouts Skelter holy original robots with someone trickle bodies 40 mm in diameter and 110 mm in length scout carries a sensor payload used to relay environmental information to other robots the most common skull payload is a small video camera but other payloads such as microphones are also used video data is broadcast to other systems via and analogue RF transmitter scouts communicate with other robots using an RF data link 1 specialised scout has a camera mounted in a custom pan tilt allowing the robot to view its surroundings independently of the orientation of its body the scout has two modes of Locomotion to allow it to navigate different kinds of terrain and obstacles the first mode uses it wheels hello I need to drive over smooth surfaces the scout demonstrated ability to climb a 20 degree slope the second mode of Locomotion is the Harp the Harp is accomplished by winching the Scouts springford up around its body and then releasing it suddenly the scout jumps over an obstacle scouted employed by Rangers the ranger is a modified commercial all terrain robot the ranger uses a launcher to deploy scouts into the area in which they were operate Ranger can carry and shoot up the 10 scouts from it's launch Rangers supervised the Scouts working with other Rangers Rangers report to a human group leader the Scouts are designed to withstand the impact of landing and of being shot into and through obstacles such as the simulated windows the scout small sized it's deployability through launching and it's multiple locomotion modes and sent her pillows give it the ability to explore difficult to reach areas and Report useful data combining the Scouts with Rangers which provide the ability to travel longer distances and to have greater computational resources forms a useful reconnaissance and surveillance team ok what do you think I guess we need a robot to do the long I mean to learn this devices so one more but is still need ok so after completing the four kinematic after finishing the jacobian we're ready now for dynamic are you ready alright so well Dynamics and then we will do the control and that you have the base kinematics dynamics well here is an example robots that involves a lot of data just imagine like moving the hand little bit you can see all the coupling forces coming on other hands on the body as you stop moving you have all the articulated by the Dynamics that are going to appear in the Dynamics of the system is quite complicated in fact if we go to this problem we we will find out we we need to really understand the Dynamics of just wondering and then combine these different Dynamics together to understand the articulate upgraded multibody so to do that that is to find the de nom an articulated multibody there are several formulations in fact there are many many formulations we will examine 2 of when is the Newton hello formally have you heard about news yes so what does say to you Newton Ella what does it tell Newton law is you're saying acceleration equal to the force so that is if your player Force to a particle it will Accelerate along the same direct with an acceleration that is equal to the force divided by the mass so what about what does Google dynamic you know hello angle you know hello parameters so hello was looking at angles why angles measure what rotational so linear motion because Force acceleration of a massive particle going to be a linear Dana and where is dealing with the other side dynamic rotational now if you have a particle then the disability not rotational motion to taka so we got a Bridget buddy we find that we need to address the problem angular rotation angular motion and that is the family combination of Newtown Angela equation extended to the problem multipass so we will examine articulated multibody dynamics we will find similar to the way if you remember we found the jacobian by analysing the static forces propagate you're a member wee wee break all the vagina remove the joints and look at stability of each of the rigid body we are going to do the same thing with their name then we will examine another formulation a formulation that captures the whole Dynamics linear and angular in one equation that is the Lagrange equation and this formulation is relying on the internet that the kinetic energy of you know what is that kinetic energy both of you what is the kinetic energy associated with a particle moving at a velocity V 1/2 envious quite very good an also the potential energy and that will lead us to a very interesting form that was give us the Dynamics of articulated by the system receipt form you remember how we did the explicit form for the Jacobi we can find the jacobian as I said what contribution of the different velocities at the different things well we're going to do the same we're going to find the Dynamics of the whole articulated body sis as a song of the contribution to the mass properties inertia and mass we establish something called the mass match associated with the dynamic and we will see that from finding the energy just finding the kinetic energy or April each of those planes adding them all together to find the total in we will be able to obtain the dynamic so this form is really important and we will examine this phone probably on Wednesday but let me just to start to give you an idea about what is happening when we look at the dynamic this is a robot from free School the ma manipulator 23 it is a cable driven robot so all the Motors are in the back and the cables are driving this track so if we go and analyse the inertia view just one acts that say the first acts so you have big in nature smaller in by putting the masses away from the axis you are increasing the inertia for sieve about this so this initial then depends on old the mass distribution the lengths the the Lord etc that is associated with the menopause if we go here we have also changes in the in Irish received but it's independent of the previous so there is a structure to the way the inertia is affected by the motion of the stretch and the configuration is going to change the value of that initial that you are if you want I can show you the questions I don't Stephen here we go so the first inner surface from this joint is like half the page it's sine cosine and all of these things and depending on how do you say I mean we can all send this it's not a problem the problem is to understand what the structure this question is how we can find those properties and how we can understand them when we analyse later when we later analyse the explicit form you will see that essentially we're going to be able to again like with the Joker I going to be able to see today now play just by looking at the structure is another robot this is this was analysing my teeth this is a robot that can carry 80 kg great heavy rope so robot that has sex degrees of freedom and we are performing just something as almost on the different joins I'm going to believe joint five or joints for we have basically newmotion just letting the trying to be controlled 80 position so what do we see we see that on the top the lower joint on the robot during the Sinners or motion of the other joy there is little of Fatima you can see some errors but there's are sort of filter underlord 4 and 5 UC lodger that is reflecting the fact that if you have a heavy time is there are disturbances the inertia the inertia of the robot is going to play the role of a filter it's going to somehow rejected the disturbances and we will see little of fat on those drive because they are quite heavy and it is just taking me think about a truck moving fast and you hit it with fly not going Matilda fly it is really terrible so so this is The Fly and that iPlayer is the track so if you want Thursday Quest we're going to establish this equation the question is avac so Gama is the apply for the robot sometimes we call it too gamma what is what will this 4 affected depending on the configuration the gravity and it's dependent on the configuration for instance we take this joint if we put the weight you're going to feel a total if I take the joint to here what is the Tour due to the gravity so you get that frigo app basically the gravity is going to ask understructure and not on the qw is the acceleration and Ms mass acceleration so MS ok cu double that is the vector of acceleration and m very good so much somatic what's X Factor will give you a voucher so mqw is going to be the inertial forces generated at 0 volt by The Motion why the axolotl what's the time so it's playing the role of armistice I had one degree of freedom ul and standard mass acceleration m is iMac but because this is a motor buddy system it's going to be a mathematics and the mathematics if we had a robot that is prismatic SO3 prismatic joint essentially along the day God will you will see the element representing the masses the total masses reflected here here and at the last and it will be diagonal bed for articulated body with revolut joints you're going to have after a general terms that represent the cup that is the motion of one joint will accelerate the others what about the v this is a fact that is function of q and Q so forget my what maybe later so what would be the thing that will depend on the so standing like this so there is a force pulling call centrifugal force yes now if you have multiple multiple baby that are moving in addition to centrifugal you will have coronavirus that is the product of velocities that will be involved Wilkos a both centrifugal so cool as I said is your address coordinates m is called the mathematics all the kinetic energy matrix because this mass matter is associated with the kinetic energy of the if you're just a particle and what is the kinetic energy for a mass m a particle what is the kinetic energy associated with the with this Mars when it's moving at a velocity V 11 half MV squared well it is the same for a mass Matrix multibody it's going to be 1/2 how do you do MV Square for a map associated with articulated bodies and the mass is a metre so you get AV transfers and m and V which makes it quadratic form and basically your kinetic energy is just one half Q that transfers and cuter this all the centrifugo coriolis forces and we will see accident police forces disappear if the velocity was there or if the mass Matrix was console that is the v turn solid depends on the velocity product of velocity on the floor that all the element involve or derivative partial derivative coming from parcel delivery the last match so if you have an asthmatic that is constant then the derivative are 0 and we will be 0 yes mathematics or kinetic energy matter and gravity forces and gallery vagina so gamelan will be acting along or about axis1 so you have Q10 GhanaWeb U2 right so I could be a force if the joint is is bad again in the formulation recent poetry service figure before if you have a rigid body you can study that the stability of the you can stay the static equilibrium the recent body under the forces of Flight and you say the song of The Fosters should be zero if there is abedi was ecstatic Calabria and the woman's computed about any point going to be 0 as well now if the money is moving so here the rigid body is a static equilibrium we do that videos movie then the reason that is the Masters and getting their shots are going to generate an additional Force we saw this first here the first Force mqw philosophy actually this or initial Force the AI created by bye the fact that this is Irish baby with mass so if we can compute the forces and the moment associate this rigidbody yes well we can Louis come little later we can create the spring and damping in the control stabilize and control the robot or the rabbit my might have some damping at the joint because of but always comes to that so if we if we consider this forces then we can repeat the statically on by saying as it is moving we should have a static equilibrium that will equal will be equal to zero but rather to ask and to end the doors moment and forces open so when we can come up with relationship the festival for the Newton equation you're we saw the question earlier the music boutonnet equation is describing the linear motion the equation is this disturbing the angular motion so mass acceleration equal moment equal in acceleration angular acceleration Philosopher's Stone that creates the centrifugal coriolis forces and bye stating better calibrium and then doing the projection on access your number in the static analysis we projected on the axis to see the forces acting on that acts so this is essentially eliminating natural forces internal forces acting on the structure then we will be able to fine the equation David Attenborough Project Life needed in the static case and fine what's component that is the force applied each of the joint so this is basically the Newton alert for Malaysia now the labrant Family song doesn't go into the specific motion of each of the joint doesn't require any elimination it looks at the problem differently from energy analysis point of view so essentially what we going to do there redic the whole articulated buddy system and we take the kinetic energy of each of the legs so the kinetic energy of a link is the Sage play I the total kinetic energy of the system is the sum of all the chaos and we have also the potential energy now once we decided about our system of units in this case it will be cured hu1 2QN we can ride the kinetic energy in this phone earlier we we saved the kinetic energy of an article buddy system would be just this Cuba transfers and cute and this means that KRK is half the velocity vector transparent by the metre what's X Factor gives you a skill now if you did was Kayla and combine it with the potential energy you will be able to images to find the circulation now what's your fantasy questions actually realise I know the equations actually that directly from an my computing the kinetic energy identify m which will go here so you're not in Cuba turn the potential energy you know you know the gravity what is left in V and we will see that what we know and we can find so before equation the Dynamics can be opening simply my taking the potential energy taking its gradient and that gives EG the gravity vector and by taking an and computing and how can we computer when we can see the kinetic energy should be if if we have a system of jazz for dinner it's a quadratic form on visualise velocity so from the top weekend say the kinetic energy could be computed for each rigidbody and by density between the first expression and this expression we can be done to fight Google see that I'm once this is so I tried to restart before that is behaviour of breaking the structure and analysing each of them and then eliminating internal Force well this is exactly what you're going to do again now but by adding the inertial force in addition here we we are at static equilibrium the rigid body is not moving if it is moving the ladies first and then we can say the forces if I are equal to if I plus if I press one from this relation the sum of the forces should be equal to the linear acceleration and the summer's woman should be equal to the angular initial Force and this is the algorithm basically that we will find this allows you to come to the dinner the new Talbot does the following velocities we know we did that positive couldn't you propagate velocities you as you propagate velocities you computer accelerations combat simulations you can compute the initial Force as your proper get and then it has a about propagation that is the projection on the axis by taking these forces and starting from the end and going back you properly your forces and when you reach the ground basically then you have all your fault tell we're going to start with the bass and the reason for that I want you to understand a very important equation related to the rigid body and this is the lyrics we need to understand what is the inertia of a rigid body if you were working just with a single article of mice and the problem of the very simple we don't need other request we are working with rigidbody when they know this rigidbody has a mass distribution and we need to capture the mass Distribution at some point and that result into this intership answer that we are going to use describe the rotational motion of a rigid now this might be scary but it's going to be really really simple if you just pay attention will start from a particle we take everybody and look at it as a collection of particle and then you will look at the linear velocity of each of those Particles and they move and we give them together and we will find the inner associated with the reset button ok sounds good listrak as I said for a particle and if we apply a force the Ruby and acceleration that is equal to f / dismiss so the matter is resisting to accelerate the muscles Infinite numerous the lighter the faster with the smallest so this is the law I think everyone is familiar with the velocity actually with this acceleration that is not along with the acceleration depending on Holbeach musically is going and we can think about this immigration in the following way so I'm going to go the nurse and that's elevation using the derivative of the velocity so you can write the same equation in this phone the possibility of MV is equal to the force what is envy by the way I'm sorry exactly it is the mantle associated with this linear motion the linear momentum and V is the linear momentum of the past so this linear woman is playing a really interesting role can you see what is this role here if we think about the senior Wilmington the rate of change of momentum is equal to the Black Horse nice so the rate of change of the linear woman Tom is equal to the force we're going to show actually question already does it says the angular momentum if we know the government to take the rate of change of momentum is equal to and with this symmetry basically then we will be able to compute the Spencer or this initial metrics associated with rigidbody so the rate of change of the linear momentum is equal to the applied Force and we called The Little Women fight ok can you remember that fight is equal to empty CBS is not that complicated let's talk about the environment how can I make an angular momentum so we have responsible rotating and have an initial frame and I'm going to confuse the England women well basically I need to the cost for that this with a vector right to confuse the moment of the force and then I can have the moment of the initials so if we did the moment of this falls on the right with respect to the origin o then we can everybody is like a force like it's an emotional Force angry rodri so so we're going to take the moment of this equation with respect to or so we need the back door that connect to O2 the particle to the position of the party right ok let's take a moment to remember the moment is VCars overwrite or t-cross video this is a very important if you understand this everything that we will talk about l will become just adding all of them together so I had a linear motion I'm just looking at it from thank you very much and point of view and I'm just taking the moment this equation with respect to a fixed bond because f is a moment we call it 10 what is this too complicated so you said earlier MV is the linear moment I'm going to take t-cross envy and if I take by cross envy and I need to to get the rate of change of that quantity this is sort of the England women team and I'm computing it ahead of time just to show you what it's going to be so we do the conversation it will be be cross and Vida v-cross and v&v cassandra's equal to zero so that gives you because when you cross product of Vector with itself it gives you 0 so that gives you the race of this quantity equal to the moment and that the Anglo woman so the ligamentum is envy and angry woman from the vector rotating and cross MV ok will putting down so now you have to remember NV marmiton pmv angry moment red ok well yes we got arrested by the over to need is to do the sun so this will become PR MI and VI and we're going to have all these particles many of the so instead of doing this with the Duster family will do an integral and because we have object in three-dimensional space with shorts triple into go in the x y and z and basically you get your fibrillation so let's call it first discounted DMV recorded file the angular momentum so so I'm going to now think about the situation in the context of originality Angela women summer holiday now we want to find the angular momentum of all the parts and has shown that this rigid body is moving out velocity and acceleration related to the instantaneous angular velocity and acceleration we we know so we need to locate each other particles so we have PPI and the linear momentum is I'm sorry the linear velocity v i that particle is going to be we studied at the English Patient it will be omega.com so what is angular momentum the total angular momentum of the body is going to be the song All the Pio locating this mi masses moving as VI velocity so now we're going to take the eye and bring them down here hey Google hey VI Cross mi Omega Crosby I say we will have a more complicated expression so we have omega CrossFit this would be the total angular momentum of the body right the Ivy if I can count them all all the party it's difficult to count that's what's nice about the mathematical model that you can use you can assume it's assumed that I can count them now in dissertation do you see anything that is construct that is not changing that is independent of division louder louder 4 m all these particles on moving rotating about that access widowmaker independent so what are we looking for if I make it is independent of the ham going to go to an interview I need to give you something out of the sunrise we don't need it in the sun so how do you do that I'm sorry so basically the Omega is on the left side you can feel if you put Minors you can bring it to the other side Omega class p or minus speaker right you remember this and the other thing is the fibre mi am I representing that man for the particle if we assume that we have a homogeneous then we can represent represent the mass by the small volume X the density so using this and using this well I didn't do it yet still so we Gotta Go from that song to this integral did the same equation before tripping this but this is what we need to get this out of this equation is independent of the equation so the fai is your total angular momentum so literally like this in this Halloween way I'm going to write it - t-cross and Omega out and that is and also substitute with the cross product operator because is B hat and that leads to this phone inhale what you see is minus p heart my x t has Ruby all of this is variable depending on the party Omega is cost so far is sequel to this integral x omega and this integral is essentially your inertia Danish of division what do you call the insurance so we can write it simply like this why is equal I omega so maybe I went too fast you see this relation where I is this integral so for linear motion why is equal ng41 classical we have Newton Aycliffe we stay as the rate of change of Y is equal to s another writing of ma ecole remember this 15 primary colour people are afraid of Normanton navigate to see the same thing the rate of change of the angular momentum is equal to applied moment so why is equal I omega and every question is simply the rate of Change apply is equal to the applied moment couldn't be any songs right then you will be missing something now £5 is not as simple as as the linear motion when you take the day off of 5 UK I am a dad like mass acceleration but also because because of omega we have I Omega another particle velocities and that produces centrifugal and coriolis so we have the two equations for a decent body so I didn't daddy has a linear motion if I throw this like straight at you it will it's going to return there will be some air resistance and you will fit fuel pump from rotational motion this combination of linear motion and angular motion is captured by this for long division well I have to deal with Morphy Richard buddies at ashmei this time and when you put a joint you are putting a constraint you're throwing the saying it's going to to be pulled and pushed and that means we need to illuminate the internal forces in order to find the actual motion so a very important think that we established with this relation is this I and now we need to really this is the thing that I need you to remember you need to be able to compute the i40 of the rigid body of your robe so this is something that is absolutely needed and in order to do that you need to see little bit more into the structure of the Earth Summit all the English accents so you said that answer I is basically this integral over the volume all the Victorious locating all the points on the body and scared by the density masters in leadership stop if we take the Square today be happy hat so this is the cross product operator it and I bet you can revert it in this phone so p heart is what you remember her the cross product operator is a three-bedroom so if you multiply 3 by 3 matrix by itself you're going to get another match now this mattress could be written as transpose PD transpose b is is what Estella so what are scaling business supposed to be is the square of the vector field so what ice-clean that you don't see much the Dragon of the identity matrix to have the square the component of the vector AP miners BP transpose wishes at 3 by 3 mm I'm using this relation we can revise the inertia tensor in this phone so lipstick this competition soapy transpose B is x squared + Y squared + 6 MP transport 3 x 20 gives you this country nothing complicated gives you if I have x y and z I'm going to * PP transfers that we give me this matter the result will be mismatch soul miners bihar bihar in that integral is this ok is Ashley this is locating the position x y and z with this vector and multiplication is a few slides Direct so we're almost there we need to control compute the integral of the and the density and that then we will have the new sentence answer is you see the situation here no I'm going to put it in that integral and I will find II xx iyi z&i XY it's anything remarkable about this matter you can tell me property wise symmetric what else positive definite that's if you're at 0 Siri you're in a black hole so Wi-Fi xxyyzz and the I like this just we I'm using the previous match complete this element and this is your initiative understand now getting the short answer already it is history by symmetry is it going to each of the points finding the distance and then you walking and integrating all of these from each of the component 25 what is the rating the initial properties about the axis xx about x axis y axis y axis and let all the coupling between different The xx yyz I'll call the moment of inertia and the other one I called the product of alright who is an example if we take her Whittaker Alisha Marie that is nice symmetrical Pandora basically the property of symmetry when you you do the integration you're integrating between one side to the other and that is to some nice properties because if you do this competition at the centre of Mars you are going to be able to find the initials and you will find most of the time 0 product and then if you need to do this competition as a different point or what you need to do is now to look at your vector so if you start from this factor this point you will be able to which always different voice then if you start from a different point the reason this point you can go like this and possible this one you already used to find the NHS about the centre of mass all that you need is to add this back that's because you're going to add the same picture for all the points it turns out that you have a very nice property which is the property of parallel axis theorem that tells you the inertia about any point a is the inertia about the centre of mass plus the mass of the average x Visconti that is the quantity that latest computer BC this Vector in addition because all the masses are basically can be amazing like goes untreated as this one this property is very nice because you can do simple competition add the centre of mass and then just do your transformation to move to a different one an example of AQ where we do the competition as the centre of mass you have this example and the answer is you get you get there I XX at the centre of mass and centre of mass and I ZZ at the centre of mass equal to Ma Square / 6 for this cute now if you want to do this competition as one of the edges like at this point all that you need to do is to add this quantity that represent the distance from Dartford to the centre of Mars and skills by the centre of mass and you're playing this country so this is a very useful hearing if you are doing this competition and what you notice also is that then you will have product of fine so the at the centre of nice you have no product of the nursery have a dragon on Netflix when you compute the inertia zaatar a different point of the centre of mass you are going to have a cup winners now we have the initial that isn't ready then we can apply the Patience of Newton la and we do this propagation and we will compute all the initial forces at ASDA and then we project back to come to the forces and we find the dynamic equation so as we saw these are the two equations the translational motion and rotational motion and what you need to do also is to compute accelerations you remember here we saying you need to complete velocity finder accelerations and then you can find the initial Force so we can go over this time I'm not asking you to follow the details of this competition that essentially you you're going to start from the velocities the recursive relation of velocity zazu propagate Omega I + 1 = omega the joint velocity of data and you have this relation now if you take the derivative of this relation euro find this delivered involving the acceleration of your joint euro also need to compute the linear accelerations you start with the velocities you think the videos and you get the other person of relations ok so we are forward for forgetting to to go to the last giant and you have a lot of hurdles depending on the type if he is a prismatic or not and because we have to find the velocity and acceleration of the centre of mass only add angles so you need to small edition the linear velocity at the centre of mass you need to * this vector Omega I + 1 and I'll give you the velocity is acceleration at the centre of mass and now you're ready so at the centre of mass you can write the forces the linear and angular forces so this is the initial forces acting at the centre of mass and these are the linear forces are acting and the centre of mass and this is the inertia tensor computed at the centre of now you think this moving accelerating rigid body and you say all the forces applied to the selected body should be the cost of the initial forces and acceleration are related to the moment through the other quiz and your sister questions and now you do recursive relations with please expressions and you get your recursive relation so now you see it is Fi as a function of I passed one so you're not propagating and as your back properly to have to make sure in order to find the torch the project on the axis so we did this we do this and now we have the recursive relation then Project YouTube you're in you can do it from here or else computed from here you have this relations oh my god I'm lost so you can see is it is wonderful him in fact to come true to your your faults as a function of the velocity acceleration in their shells and masses and every but you have no idea about what's going on it's very difficult to see you need to this is Iceland directions from 0 to 5 and invitation world eliminate your ok yeah well I need it can for asking can go to muddyfox yeah well we didn't talk about the door this year gravity ups celebrity before the gravity how do I cancel the gravity in this algorithm tell ok you remember I said that you start from the days you assume the days 800 acceleration and you move out and you come back now if you want to account for the gravity what should we do just sat very good so if you say I have a linear acceleration sequel to wengie from the beginning you will be including the wood I love you signant hello so good we Google kittens and just keep it I will go to here and we go to the Lagrange equation so what do you say the things you have to remember and not forgetting is how to compute your energy we need still to computer but not sure because when we go and compute the the kinetic energy that is needed in Lagrange formulation you are going to compute the linear motion kinetic energy which is 1/2 MV Square and what about the angular motion the kinetic energy associated with Angela omega so it is 1/2 Omega transpose I omega so we need this I anyway you can not escape so you have to know how to computer alright ok Lagrange equations actually then we can skip that if you want an innovate what I meant is we really don't have to do know all the details of the questions that I really want you to understand Lagrange equations because they are going to be very useful for you when you're when we get to control and when we are going to control the robot the robot it's on dynamic and also we are going to apply to it external forces 2 controller so this external forces are going to affect the dynamic of the road in some way and we need to understand the Lagrange equation not only to come through the dynamic between each for the Dynamics of the Connecticut and we know the answer from Lagrange equations from Newton Abbot from any formulation of the dynamic equations we will have the same structure Matthew w + V + 3 = ent to compute the mass orbit we need is to computer Connecticut mum we really need to understand what what is the structure of Lagrange equation how under applied forces mechanical system is going to so this it has a very important role not only for the Computing the dynamic that's really too understanding the control ok how many of you have seen this equation let's imagine this equation in the skillet so this equation would be just simply an equation where the torque is the torque applied to 21 lovely join so this is a scalar equation what is L of you have seen it before so it is 19 and it is simply the kinetic energy - to potential in and what is the skew when we when we look at ok maybe I think I have I have paid minus you so l is k - you I don't know if I will put it in the most of the time when we are talking about natural gravity the EU is only function of where what height you are so it's function of cute so we can revive this equation in this phone right I'm supporting the kinetic energy from the potential energy because the potential energy is independent of the time so you can write it in this way and essentially what you have in here you have mqw V if you have motability and here you have the garden so here you just have the gravity back so in fact if we need to go to the other side let's not worry about the gravity in space oh and it's just the Greedy of your potential energy it's saying that your initial forces are equal to the total minus the acting credit end if we think about it this part of the initial first this is what he's going to give you when was We Do The Division that last part will give you mass acceleration forces equal to the total mass of the gravity so let's look at this little bit as I said the kinetic energy if we have German as well we say you is original coordinates that is so nice velocities we can drive the kinetic energy as a quadratic form on the joyful it's ok is Q that transfers mqd end if we take the derivative so I'm going out to do taken escape from there and differentiate with a spectacular ok supportive care with respect to this country and this is Cuba transposing so what do you think of dinosaurs don't like to do it in the skillet so you are taking let's say I'm taking v square 1/2 MV squared and I'm taking the parcel delivered with respect to V what would be the answer Evie well in the in the latter case it would be envy as it will be emptied so nice this is very nice so now the second derivative of this I mean this the derivative of time so if you take the derivative of an cubic with respect to time you get mqw glass and door sugar you see why I'm that because I'm is function of q function of Curacao UK end up shooting so let's write this we computed this and it is this first part is mqw plus induction what about the other part uck over I need to find the partial derivative of the scale with respect to the queues so in the kinetic energy what is dependent on The Cube can you play that to me ok the kinetic energy is 1/2 Q dot transfers Mr of cu so what is different on queues so I'm going to lie did as I've asked her because this is what does this mean it's positive with respect to q1 partial derivative with execute too far from Dover to for the spectacle sorry sliders so I'm just writing exactly that quantity partial derivative with respect to Q 12 q and ok you agree so everyone who have never seen that question before is this clear this means mass acceleration mqn WWE disappear if Emma sconce not configuration dependent this would be 0 and this would be easier this Messi think is your centrifugal coriolis forces any element of this product and product of velocity you have always accused that killed at that is x this is what we call V Vee this vector - half of this and this is ok so this equation the possibility the kinetic energy leads to this equation as I said because we received the answer United computer m right but my is very in the kinetic energy and this thanks of function of m so we're ready just to computer and from the kinetic energy and we know the answer by the way do you know why this we already saw this example what is the answer is next I've been away to think about it is to form a victory which is m √ m cubed and then your equation will be featuring supposed to for the kinetic energy and then you can show that if you if you want to do to see why it is equal to impute alright so the equation of Motion using Lagrange equations are in this phone masts acceleration Plus these two factors leads to V vector that is function of q and coding and if you that is equal to 0 V10 so this is the structure of our Dynamic Earth and what way no is inside the kinetic energy is this an if I can compute the kinetic energy some other ways then I will find out and what you going to do we going to go to each of the Desert I'm confused that kinetic energy 4223 2kn add them all together and identify that expression to this expression and we can extract and once we have an using this relation between V and in Duckula the vector we will be able to compute the V so this is what we will be doing on what's the
