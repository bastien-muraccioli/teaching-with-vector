alright let's start ok so a few announcements before we start so if you have if you need a a comedy please let us know if you haven't done that already so you need to let us know by October 31st take me to figure out so I will get back to you about the exam take me to let us know by October 30th project proposals are also do this Thursday 238 so do you want to talk about gay so so we have started talking about this idea of state space models as a way of representing everything about everything at you to plan for the future we talk about search problems already if you've talked about please where we had a setting gruvia playing against the nature and the nature can play by probabilistic and then based on that we need to read Anthony Warner Chappell so so the setup is as we have 2 players playing at not necessarily playing against nature actually playing another intelligent like exercising for 40 stone so that's kind of the main idea of so so what started an example to this action example that you so the example is we have 3 buckets We Have A B and C and then you choosing one of these three buckets and then I choose a number from them and the question is well you're going here is to maximise their shows a number and the question is which bucket so how many of you would choose but no one trusts how many YouTube VR YouTube free how are you making the way your making this decision is if you choose a you're basically assuming that I'm not playing like I'm not trying to get you I might actually give you and if I give you 15 lb and you have this very large if you think I'm going to adversarial against you and then try to minimise to your then you going to choose Cosworth getting are you all Tuesday the lowest number of the book and the lowest number is 1 better than - 50 and chilling I'm trying to adminimize you're good then you're going to choose and then if you have no idea on playing and then you're just something maybe I'm acting as the Catholic Lee and maybe on flipping a coin and then based on deciding what number to give you you might to see because in expectation she's not bad right like-for-like if you just average age is number and then pick the average values from a b c and d and c the average value for a 04 B2 and enforce it 5 I'm playing as the classical you might save I'm probably going to give you something around if you want to talk about these different policies everywhere shoes in this settings and how should my alarm and how we family this is an example ok so the plan is to formalist talk about how we compute values in the setting of games that you can talk about expecting accent I'm going towards the end of the lecture we're going to talk about how to make so we can talk about evaluation functions as a things faster Richard using domain 222 define evaluation functions over now we also wanted by the alpha beta pruning which the more general way of pruning your three what is the letter we just to find a scheme and a way to go by the scheme is to create something that's called again is very similar to so this remind you of surgery where we talking about it like two weeks ago so so the idea is we have this country where we have notes and industry and each node is a decision point we have different players here that I was wondering are you replying on two different people thank you for this decision could be 411 and then it's route to me that is going to be a possible at so like you could be Dad I'm choosing - 50 and then your decision was to pick but it's a so that pass is going to give one possible outcome that is weather today so the notes and in the first level or the decisions that I was making it the first know the roots now or the decision that you sorry for metaphor my dissolving formalize this problem as a two-player zero so in this class today you're going to talk about two player where we have an agent and we haven't and then we are going to talk about all season now using for all of those things think of yourself I've been the agent so you're playing for the agent you're optimising for the 8th opponent is opponent so we are also going to today we're going to talk about games Dad or turn taking games to room talk about things like chess you're not talking you paper scissors we'll talk about the election next time like simultaneous today we're talking about torrent two-player turn-taking set who are the ability to see everything or not talking about the games like poker or you don't necessarily see when you have portal operation you don't necessarily City your opponent Forza racing 2 player and also 0 what's 0 cm means if I'm winning and if I'm getting my turned hours from being in then my phone it is losing the total utility is going to if I win something my phone it is loose alright so so what are the things that we need when so so we need to know the players we have opponent in addition to that you need to find about your things this remind you of if you like you're so we might have a start date start we have actions the function of state which gives the possible action before successor function similar to search problems so successive function takes the state and action and it tells us with the if you're going to and you're having it is and function with checks if you're an in-state or not and I think that's different things what is the futility funk and utility function basically gives us the agency torch what makes you notice here is is that the utility only comes and so after you finish the game I got played by and I want just now I do this just and then will I get my as I'm making moves Like through my telescope I'm not getting it only delete ODEON another way to find me you told me it's your defining it for the agent replying from prospective of the age so what would be the utility of your opponent location of Dad about partially observable Markov decision process is this partially of the Roman Colosseum not a part of the overall Mark there are classes that talk about letters decision under uncertainty baikoko Converse glasses you should you should take classes and this is not for your server you have two players YouTube the question is are there any rare and so far I haven't discussed later another child took actually do you mind the nature in the middle that act around so far two players alright and everything that we need to be fine when your defining a game is it's the player so so so player is a functional and basically tells us who is in like always in the game of chess acoustic and that is a function that define and formally defining and again alright so selfless weekend so we have a game of chess players or white and black better you're applying for whites of the agent is white the opponent is black and then the status can represent the position of our pieces and Houston that is going to wipe the state is so who's players to turn it and positioning off stop actions would be all the legal chess moves that toy as can take and then is end basically checks if the state is checkmate or that is what so the utility will be will be if you're like you're only going to get it when you win or when you lose or off there's a drop the way your defining it is it's going to be put infinity if white the agent is white and and it's going to be 0 if if there is and then it's going to be minus Infinity h all the things that why do we have why do we have post this in the state so that's one way of extracting the player functions you can find a fire from the front the state already missing code whose turn it is so I can handle reset YouTube so so so this is turn-taking right I take an action and an opponent a connection and the Nugent a connection appoint a connection at the very end of the game then then you'll get there totally and an opponent gets in the negative what actions could be very different poster condition like very important black wings so so I'm talking about 0 some games here because you're talking about our 40 some games like you're going to die minimax type policies minimising in the age of that's maximising I'll get back to you if I haven't answered that like we can talk about it after the next which I will talk about more variations of GameStop but for now I'm assuming a bunch of SIM if we're doing smelly white gets down but like it's my so and then kind of the characteristics of games that already discussed that I don't think this one is that all utilities are at and stayed so throughout this past you're not getting any toast adversary like things like and we were getting great words like to add but here are the only counting at the very end and the other thing about it is that different players are in control you might not be able to control thing in control thinks it might be a report turn anyone on of the two main characters what's a game Dad you're going to play so the game is happening so we start with the number and and then the player can deploy your take turn and they can do two things I can either subtract one second Aquaman end or they can replace n with an over 2 so they can divide or and the player that's left with zero as is going to so sad status try to formalize the game and after that you want to figure out what is a good policy it's the right now what's this try to what's the Strait of hormuz are there different things for tomorrow arceaux so just have a new file we are going to the finest game having game alright sorry initialising with answer is starting with some number and so what is our federal state is going to encode who's player Turner dandad number cancel play Alicia our players are either + 1 or - 1 that's how are you finding start status iPlayer plus 1 please with what's 1 and 10 and then we need to define it send ok so what it is in Czech will we take the state with the couple in two player and number and if the number is equal to 0 than that is when the game ends that are ending condition about Utility well we get the authority identity so again I take a state I decouple into player and number I make sure that you're on in an in-state so we start that number is equal to 0 cos that kind of you find if your nan stayed or not and then you told me I'm going to get if I'm reading I'm going to get infinity if I'm not doing I'm going to get minus Infinity the way on defining at here is by just doing player x in cause player AMD agent and the Player plus one the opponent is playing minus wine that how minus one is winning I'm going to get mine the actions that you can do is we can subtract 1 or We Can Divide divide by 2 by the main actor and players fire function against a state I'm going to be couple of the state into player and number and just return to player that I know whose players tennis and then we need to define the successor function the successor function takes this state and an action and tells us what state you're going to so against I'm going to be coupled into a player and number and then the actions I can take or two things I can either subtract 1 alright can I Can Divide so if I'm subtracting then I'm going to return you state which is - fire because that's my little monster what's my - weather turned it is now and then I'm going to number one if the action is the white you're going to return the new fire which is minus fire and number Dubai that is so so we just define alright so that was my game we're going to play this game in over a bit who is quickly before playing at let's talk about what is a solution to a game like what are you trying to do Sophia and defuse the solution to a game was with the policy so policy with the function of state it would have turn the action that you need to take in that the peace here we have but the thing is I have to force a policy should depend on the player to so I have powers p which is the policy of Playa p play some water before it can be a policy as a function of a state and it can return just an act and this would be the termina stick like the term mystically if I'm in state the policy is going to tell me what define stochastic what's the capital cities with do it will take a stick and action and then they would return a number between 0 to 1 which is the probability of taking that policy pipe of a station action basically overturned the probability of player taking action if you remember the bucket example like maybe half the time I would the number on the right and half the time I will pick the number under the left that would be a stochastic policy right I'm not deterministically telling you what yeah I'm coming up with the stochastic radio white party in our game Netflix party can you speak up and opponent is acting deterministically if you know exactly what they're doing sometimes have no idea maybe like I've learnt it somehow I have some random this there and then I'm going to my opponent but we're going up like what we get our other stochastic vs deterministic forces a little bit more alright so ok so now let me know that it's the policy that you wanted let's try to try to write up a policy for this and then I'm going to find a human and I'm working my dad is this is going to come from a human that means one of your race or two of you guys so so need to want us for this but that's quickly actually write this up so what is a human policy it's just going to get the input from the keyboard so so what I'm going to type up here is is get the action from from from the keyboard so get the input from the keyboard and it is going to be the action that remember the actions or I divide or sub and if action is valid then return that action that sounds like a good good so that is the human body so now what I want to do is I want to have like this game that actually playing against policy for my agent my agent is possible it's going to be human policy my opponent I'm guessing my phone it is also human policies I just want to human to play a game and game is what's a VR starting with 50 so are number that you're starting with so that looks right to me so how do we how do we ensure that we are progressing in the game so if you're in another state if you're not in an interview one progress so what's printer watch everything here turn down stat let's get the player out of the state against iPlayer let's get the policy cos we've defined his policies for both of the players we can get the policy for weather is playing right now and then the action comes from the policy state and then you stayed you're going to end up it's just a successor of the current state I'm just this way lupia just figured out what stage your in with policy or without and where we going to end up at and that another variant I'm just going to print out utility so that's either pass infinity or am I so what's happening ok that's one person you're the agency or pull your first one appointment 3 I think you were first ok so you're a -1 alright so let's play is this large enough so player one player plus 1 we are number 15 I get some wireless so you're a player - 1 we had 14 what you want you have a policy - divide identify rights they make you move down and then basically kind of cancer what's the date like another pair with the code online if you want play with it you have one of the Russian playing with an automated policy later alright so ok severe back here so just so how we can do some human policies and the human passes playing against each other and against the policy with the state and action if use your problem or you gonna stay tanned the Tennessee passes just an instance of a stochastic so you can kind of treated as a stochastic policy where is probably one your picking your fitting in so now we want to talk about how we evaluate again so so lovely that someone comes in and gives me the policy of an agent an opponent and I just want to know how good mdp lecture we started the policy that if you make sure we start with this idea of someone give me the policy if you just want evaluate how good that I'm your kind of doing in an hour just to exactly that someone comes in and tells me that my agent is going to pickpocket and someone is going to like this and we probably won't have to give me one of the two policies that were going so the question is how good so going back to the to the treat again free what is really happening if my agent is going to pick this one right cos it's going to big bucket day so with probability one we're going to end up here with probably end up in any of these and then my phone is going to stochastically pick either -50 arceaux cancel if my phone is taking -50 or 50 then the value of this note is the expectation of 0 so 54 x 6 - 50% of the time it's 50 then the value of this notice and then if my agent is picking picking a than the value of this notice so they can see how the value is going to propagate up from utility that when we could actually computed value for each one of these note if I know what the pass my nose is all by what policies I can actually computers how you think I can say a value of the start state if I'm evaluating this particular policy is going to be someone give me the policy evaluation in general again I was just saying you earlier this is this is similar to policy there's a similar to the case that someone here for your policies and only valued but how good the situation and you can write a return stacks they compute that and so I'm going to write the recurrence so you want a computer to do this now you and the values evaluating a given policy what is going to be CO2 it's going to be go to Utility of us if you're in an intestate we are already in an estate what are ways I have access to the policy of my 140 on my agent so I can just do unexpected song over all possible actions averse let's say that I'm if player s is Agent I'm looking a posse of agent Casa Cosi x VR event of this accessory successor and this is if my player is so if is player I'm just gonna write this player on what happens if my players opponent I'm going to do something evaluating I have access to the policy of I'm again just doing going to do a sum over all possible actions are the policy of the opponent this is given to me someone gave this to me I've stayed in Action times value of the successes and this is the case that my player is there a the recurrence it's coming to you again we have seen this increases to like you start with utilities I don't know it and you just put that back up based on what your and what your parties are telling you like which sites like which edges of the tree mypal where's my phone alright ok so that was evaluating the game but what if I want to solve what the agent should do right like I'm the ages I care about doing like a blackbird with my agent whose I don't know what my agent is I need to figure out what her party I should be fine and that kind of pics this idea of expecting Max which is basically the idea if I'm gonna cry over I know what my opponent's does so I'm still so I know what my opponent what will be the best thing that I should be doing it what will we be the best thing if you knew like in the bucket example I was I was acting probabilistically what would you do maximum so you would pick it up from that give you the maximum value because you're trying to maximize your own your own value so so then if that is the case then the security to change this recurrence the weird changes is I'm going to call this new Value something do it through everything on top of this and not writing it I'm going to call this now you value of expecting match policy value I'm not evaluating anything anymore I want actually figure out what my agent should you expect and if I know the policy of my opponent I'm not changing anything here cos I know the policy of my opponent I'm just to complete this but now I want to figure out what the agent should do and what should the agent do multi-agency do the thing that maximizes Sally so I'm going to race the sun but the policy cause I want that policy and agent should do the thing that maximizes the smelly over so this remind you of valued say remember now you direction in Debbie Felix evaluating things that you were trying to maximize IRL and that's kind of like an hour just to what we're doing here you're trying to figure out what should be the policy that the agency take that maximizes the value under the scenario that I know what the opponent so going back to this example so that say I know my opponent is acting stochastically what should I do if my phone is acting stochastically we probably want had then the values of each one of these markets are going to be zero 2 and 5 and I'm trying to maximize my own my own batter you so I'm going to pick the one that gives me five and that shown with this upper triangle and trying to maximize so I'm going to but it's ok cuz I'm trying to maximum under the storage that and then mirror kindest the value of a tricky Max policy and value expected from the start state is equal to Michael Jackson filming I know my phone is bossy and I'm I'm fine I'm maximizing my own you took my own doll you knowing my phone and what you doing alright then this is this is so do we get we would just update the return so if the agent is playing then we maximum ISA value alright general I don't know your past you my princess in general I know what gives me this player so so if that is the case then what should we do so why you saying that we could do is B&Q the same worth one thing and you could do it would be like all the point it is trying to get me in and they're going to play the worst case scenario and you're trying to minimise another first thing to do when you're going to talk about that is always the best thing we can do all night a little bit later in the lecture but for now liquid assumed that if I know nothing about my phone does the soul my opponent is acting and that's fine introduces this idea of meaning azerpost expect so what with minimax that's the case album apart see what I I'm assuming is on this agent trying to maximize my my own my own value and then I'm assuming my opponent is acting adversarialism iPhone it is really trying to minimise my value and I know that news is from the spark I'm going to get - 50 from this one I'm going to get one from this one I'm going to get my S5 and under that assumption but I'm going to pick the second market because that gives me the highest that is my name so how would I change my recurrence if I were to play minimax I'm gonna I'm going to call it VR are the state the recurrence is going to be over a minute that if the agent is playing agent is still trying to maximize the value so good what if your opponent is playing the phone is going to minimise right so I don't have access to fire up so what I'm going to do is I'm going to the point is going to take an action that minimises the value of the and this is how you would compute the value obey meaning please try some YouTube what happens when always what happens if the adversarial agent is not always adversarial in that case you'll have another stochastic 40 that kind of defined where the opponent is doing and if you have access to that we can do something someone to expect you don't have access to that maybe you would want to look at for Sky and assume that they always trying to minimise but that's some prior knowledge that you have that allows you to track maybe value the value bettor forum evaluation and maybe later confirm your email so so so here the value of me Max from the start said is going to be one so I'm assuming my opponent is acting adversarially so we have - 81 and - 5 if I am acting my saying then the best thing I can get it and then that's how we computer to be off and then there is really no analogy to the cinema if you setting because and then if you don't really have this game we don't have this opponent that's playing against us and what happens is that this is a return said you were going to get ok so what with the policy for the policy is just going to be the Arc maxol this me of me so if you want to know what the policy of your agent should be at spy Max it's the Old Max of the oven over 6 letters and if you want to know with the policy of your opponent that status should be will get argument you can actually speak weather so let's go back to this example this happened so what we want to do if you want actually code up with a minimax policy we're doing this and maybe you can play with a mini Mac spot so what would it mean for the policy so it's going to be a status give US state and you're going to just write this request and let me have wonderboard so so we are requesting over the state if you're in an instant then what are we returning utility ok so we return the utility of that state and there is no and then if you're not in an intestate than your outer maximising or minimise over a set of choices so it's actually like create those choices so they can just call Max and so the choices we're going to a right over or actions that we have and what is that going to be acceptable that's going to be doing a recursion over the successor so you're going to return over the successor state recursive games successor I don't want to return the action here too get a party later and a successor in the circus function Returns a state and action and so I just want the state from the first second one ok so if player is plus one at the agent the agent is maximized the choices and if player is -1 then the dad's opponent the phone and try to minimise over and that's pretty much like this record ok so we're going to reverse over over our state and that gives the same value and it also gives us so I was just print things out please can you put on so give us an action turn it off announcer policies ok so now I'm going to do is I'm going to say pass one agent is store human policy and then it's playing against the minimax policy who won Survivor it's a little scary alright so status play Fun so you're ready agency your player one you're selling from 15 what do you want what's the game now it's playing I'm really makes policy action and says action man and I need also - so we had 6 and then the value of the game is - play it away my €40 really getting why the Sinfin I want to try this again you want try again ok so you can win right to value infinity right now and then and then a minimax policy also the minus so you are 13 your turn he just wants to marry Dad actually unified alternate between them I think that is there play with this the coders online so just feel free to play with alright so ok so that was my mate and and this is going to be the parents that be good for me mate I know what I want to do is I want to spend a little bit of time talking about some properties of this and then you talk about two types of Horses suffer but you're talking about which is basically saying as an agent I'm trying to maximise but I know what my opponent is going to do so I'm going to assume my phone and does whatever and then I'm going to back to my Facebook that I am following and I'm going to refer that to a spy of expecting night which means said the agent everything in red is for the agent everything in blue is for the airport so I'm going to say the agent is following this policy which says I'm going to maximise assuming my phone is doing whatever and here I'm coin pie 7AS like summer 957 I'm going to maximize space and the value we just talked about this the valuable Fiona value just talking about is the value of me Max which says I am the agent I'm going to maximise assuming the opponent is going to minimum the poem and actually is going to fall cancel the two values I want to talk over a bit about the properties of this mix it together ability of tidings and minimal in maths I don't 45 is it are you coming to the new policy that will be available to you too between Max and min Max and something something for your photo ID when you are proposing so we'll actually go through the first and then maybe like if he doesn't so what about the setting is it confusing so alright so where do I use read for agent my right alright I'm going to use blue for they appointed cancel servant for agents for going to have play Max agents could play climax what does that mean again I'm going to maximize assuming you're going to minimise an agent could play by expect Max maybe the policy 7 and 7 here which means I'm going to maximize assuming you're going to phone the spicy this is a thing that agents can do and then there are things that my opponent can do I'm going to ride that here my opponent can actually for pi min which is stronger minimise what are my phone is good for someone to policy hi 7 what's a pie 7 in the bucket example right now is just acting a stochastic leasowe half the time what number have the time pick another number that is what we so I'm going to draw My actually my tree so we can go over example this was the bucket example he started - 1515 bucket 1 and 3 in bucket -5 and 15 in cancel this was my bucket example I'm actually Gonna Talk I'm going to talk about it might of properties V of Pi Max and timing which is what we have been referring to as the minimax now I want talk about this the first property that we can have is that re of hi marks I mean is is going to be an upper bound of any other value of any other policy hi I'm going to just write part of expecting any other policy for the agent assuming that my opponent is playing as a minimiser ok so so what I'm writing where am I here is is a value is going to be an upper bound any other value if my agent decide to do anything else under the assumption that my opponent is a minimiser so my phone is really trying to get me if my partner is really trying to get me the best thing I can do with some Spider-Man Qatar capital what is PVR play mix by Max and timing right I'm going to go down here and I'm gonna so they are pie Max and pieminister 12:45 is this value that is just ok what is this saying is is that this is going to be greater than maybe the settings my appointment so my agent is falling it and my phone is still doing so well with this what were the style you for smart this is a value which says Roar I'm going to take an action assuming my opponent is acting a stochastic new 5 year my own value go I'm going to go into but it turns out that my partner was not doing that my opponent was actually a minimiser suck my partner was actually a minimiser and I went this right my phone is going to give you -5 devaluing end up getting is -5 so this is equal to -5 this is equal to so so far Sean the sky is greater than that's a first property first property is if my partner is terrible is trying to get me best thing I can do is to maximise I should do the second property is is dead this is me of hi Max VR himax and payment is now lower bound I was setting where your agent is maximizing so many opponent is minimising when actually not minimising your opponent was falling by 7 so what does says if you're trying to maximize assuming your agent to your your opponent is always minimising then you're doing like you're coming around and if you're pulling into doing something else you can always just do better what is what is this we just that is that is one that is this now you what does this corresponds to this is value of Primark which is I'm going to assume you're trying to get me if I'm going to assume you're trying to get me I'm going to go down this trapped because that is the thing that gives me the highest the highest value but you're not trying to get me a fine by 7 so if you're falling fine by 7 going to give me half the time one half the 53 and that actually Christmas the two and I'm going to get now you too instead of value 1 this is actually this corresponds to this value in the table which is again the agent is falling a maximiser assuming that the minimiser phone was not I was just and this is just so far the things I've shown are actually go into it if they seem complicated but they weren't whatever Sean is that this now your minimax it's an upper bound if your suming your opponent is a turbo Pony it's going to be another down to the best thing I can do is maximised I've also shown it's a low down if I put it is all as that's better security policy is completely fine Zafira actually doesn't speed up expecting it's saying stuff on it is going to fall but maybe maybe not talk about expect it's always the case that the phone and doesn't actually see with opponent but the funny can say I'm going to stop my one more property ynyslas property basically says no something actually goes out your question if you know something about your opponent right if you know something about your opponent then you shouldn't do the minimax should I clearly do the thing dad has some knowledge or what your opponent so so that basically says this week IMAX and some pie of a pint you know something about PayPal and you know that opponent is pi 7 that is going to be less than or equal to the case where you are following me Paya expecting Max 7:30 and upon what is the saying that the case where you're trying to maximize and you think your phone is minimise saying but your phone is actually not realising the value of that is going to be worse than a k well you're maximising under some knowledge of your partner's policy and your phone is faulty actually ended up doing for the first time is always the agent a second dermatology appointment so that's 1:45 are you worried about you saying the saying you are going to maximum assuming your opponent is the cast so if I'm assuming my phone and stick then I'm assuming that this is 0 this is to this is 5 I am trying to maximise so which one am Irish Lotto should I go I should go this right because that give me five this is the agent thinking up on it is going to be us the Cassidy thinking is going to get 5 and it gets here and a foreign actually end up falling 57 which is the stochastic thing you're actually going to get this guy is equal to 5 and this is the last in a quarter we are pi remax mas drevon and I have 7 is greater than or equal to BFI Max 97 Spotify alright how is weather now if you know something about this like here I knew that the opponent with a deterministic policy and always picking so I could have white forward the same expecting Max policy under that know if it could be anything else but the whole idea expecting active the policy of the opponent is it could be the time under Dad how would I know does that mean that life is always yeah so the question is do you have it yet so we have any idea so transitively the sky is always greater than this kind of makes sense right what you're saying like if you're falling expecting Max basically saying if you're falling expecting Max and you know something about your opponent and your phone actually ended up doing that so know your value should be greater than because you know something knowing having a yeah I knew what I knew that have to try and they're going to take this one and have the time to take the other one and then I use that now is the expected Max policy given a refund policy giving if your opponent is following evening policy is this policy when here we have it 615 policy 20pt is following pie opponent and assume that it has accessify opponent so then they doing this song over when do they end up being equal to each other and yeah I guess so yeah so you know that if you know your phone and is Falling with I'm gonna move hello actor in this is like what you've already talked about Sophie what I think about modifying the skips this game yet or properties of this game application one can do which is bring nature and so the real question earlier which was like is there any chance you and you can actually bring chance inside you're so so let's say that you have the same game as before your choosing one of the Three Bears an applet using one of the flu you can flip the coin and if heads comes then you can move one then to the what does mean that 50% of the time tell comes you're not changing anything you have this set up 50% of the time you get here and then in those settings you're just going to pick like a neighbouring bin as a possibly Orange this notion of Chancellor and it's kind of acting as a new player so it's not actually the making things that much more complicated so so what happened to The Simpsons we had a policy of a coin does nature here right and possibly a coin is half the time I did 0 I don't change anything half the time I just get the neighbouring bin as opposed to my name and I get this nutri where I have with your whole new level 4 what's the chance place so we have now we have Max military have minute we also have these chance notes and a chance nose again like sometimes it take me to the original bike it and 50% of times they take me to a neighbour what's the whole story like stays the same like nothing changed as you can you can still confused now you're functions against it's the same sort of return nothing fundamental change it's just it just feels like you're 3 things play so then this is actually called expecting minimax here in this case for example is minus because there is a minute for the opponent there's an expectation note for what nature does and then there is a Max note for what the agent should do that's why it's called and you can actually can't 5 Pickard in then you flip a coin and then shipped it back or not and then I get to pick the numbers vol Oasis if you have players so you have made you have coin and then the Returns changes a little bit I guess to see what happens the recursive had for minimax was just the Max and min and it would just return of the utility if you're in an ENT function in an NC now if there if it is the Queen's term we just do a Sum Over an expected sum of their policy which is why we were doing expect Jeremy Corbyn coin so everything here kind of fools natural so sorry so far is we've been talking about Max note we've been talking about chance those I could have had a coin there and then also this minute and then basically we've been talking about composing these sort of notes together and creating a maths game more or an expecting Max and and value functions of the usual recurrence I've been doing in this guy Bond expected utility to from the utility to come up with the expected utility value for all the notes that he has stop the radio other scenario that you might want to think about for example like in general other variations of game said you might want to think about so what if like the case that you're playing with multiple opponents so far we've talked about like the two player setting we have one opponent and one agent but what if you have multiple opponents I can think about how the three changes in those said for example with the taking turns at factory like it's if the game is simultaneous vs your turn-taking all I can imagine settings really have some actions that allow you to have an extra I don't know next you should think about some of these some of them come up in the homework so think about variations of games in general so does that all about the computation aspects of this so this is pretty bad how to talk about a game which is somewhat research so you think it's research approach if you remember to research lay down without using a branching factor and some depth of death and in terms of time it's exponential in order free today to die in this case I'm using d for the number of to die because the fighting the agent why is an appointment for you so that like that and then in terms of space is ordered in terms of time it's 6 minutes that's really bad so for a game of chess for example the branching Factor is around 35 5750 so if you can pay me to the two here then it goes in the order number of atoms in universe that that's not doable you should you're not able to use any so high making things fast we should be talking about how to make things there are two approaches that you're talking about in this class to do to make things faster in the first approach is using an evaluation unity validation function we can do it I can use domain-specific knowledge about the game define homicide featuring about the game in order to approximate like the value of this value function someone took my debit another approach is this approach which is kind of simple and call alphabet and the operator pwning approach basically gets rid of part of the tree if it realises you don't need to go down that that that part of the substrate so it's approaching approach that doesn't explore all the tree onlysport so we can talk about so evaluation so that's like that ok so the doctor took my really like the birth and death of the game can be really large that's not agreed so what approach to go about solving the problem is is too kind of limited so boring everything in the tree just limit the depth and and get to that recorded an after that when you get to that that's just call an evaluation Sophia Whittle search the 43 this was a return that then we had like we've talked about doing a minimax this is a recording that you got to do got over all the states in actions and and go Ronaldo but if you're using a limited depth research approach when you can do it you can basically have the step day and then decrements the every time you go over an agent an opponent like every time you go down the tree and at some point be just become zero so we get some hardcore death of the 30 you're going to call and evaluation function on the States anything else using function is almost of the same form of what future costs were talking about search so if you knew exactly what it was that then you were done but you don't know exactly what it is cos if you knew that you were to talk like that tree frog but in general I can have some sort of week estimate of what what the future cost so yeah so so any valuation fortunately valve is a week esteem RV meaning so it's a week estimate of of Europe so so analogy of dad is Future cost so how we come up with an evaluation so we do it in a similar manner that had within the learning lecture we're coming up with features and and and wait for this feature right so something like chess and I do we put it right that you think about a set of actions that we can take and where we end up and understand where we ended up at then you can evaluate how good that have some notions of features and how good looking like how good that would be from that point on and that'll be valued what when we play chess that's kind of what we do we pick a couple actions and you'll see how the world would look like after functions kind of does the same thing I try to free of all the things that we should care in a specific game in this case in inches and tries to Like U values to them so so we might be things like the number pieces we have or mobility of those pieces or if I can give safe or if we have central control not so sorry for the pieces what we can do it you can look at the difference between the number of pieces we have between what we have and without corn and also number Kings that I have his number I'm phoning that I have that seems really important I don't have a change and so so your wife would like a really large wait for Dad and you might care about like the difference between another upon Soar so Dad allows you to care about you think about how good the borders or no problem moves then you have a number so so sorry so far is so this is pretty bad order of Peter the truth is pretty bad and an evaluation function basically tries to estimate this be minimac using some domain and then I'm like as sorry I actually don't have any guarantees in terms of like from probably stardom what is an approximation people used to be good we'll talk about it a little bit later next time twitter away we should we should take for each one of these for each one of your future so you should think learning about what alright so I want to spend a bit of time and alpha beta pruning ok so alpha beta because of the phoning is also pretty simple but I think it's one of those things hours that kind of got a boy's attention can I get what it is happen so what should I do want to choose between some work today and markets and you want to choose the maximum and you know that the values of a foreign 20325 and the values of be falling to 5 so they really have like any any interest Katie I really care about you you're if you're picking your maximum right you shouldn't care about you like it or rest of your because you already know that your boss why you're happy with me you should need a weekend so so kind of the underlying concepts of alpha beta pruning is is maintaining a lower bound and upper bound on values and then if the intervals doing over laughed and basically dropping part of the subtree that you don't need to because there is there is no overlap soliciting having a minute and you're going to go down and C3 and then there's the minute so so we can get three here so when I get in a Max note here right what I know is that the max no it's going to get 3 or high that's one thing that I would know without even looking at anything Devin Booker I already know that this Max no it should get 3 or higher so so then I go down to the dismay now and I see to hear Right I know this a minute it's going to get a value that is less than or equal to 2 listen you go to The Zone having into evolve with greater than or equal to 3 so I should not worry about that so maybe you like me that here that's kind of the whole concept of what happened after later source I have Max note this was three 5 I found out the skies 3 it's going to be greater than or equal to 3 cos it's already seen three no what about you were going to get the snack snood is going to be 3 or higher I'm going to go down here and then ic2 here right it's a minute what about gets is going to be less than a recorded to so Westenra CO2 is the value that's going to get popped up here I already know what's tenor recorder to has no interval with 3 or greater so I don't even need to worry about this like I like I can completely ignore this side of the tree I don't need to know whatever is happening down here I don't even know because I like the style you should be great sorry minimum so the minimum it's a minimum night rate so it's going to be a lesson is it a minute or two if I did 10 here or 20 that like it's too long alright is 10 or 100 or whatever it is they're like we're not gonna wicked that so that is kind of the home so running is as we're going to get to songs that has some utility and that utility is the thing that is going to be pushed don't like and then dangerous thing is if you pick you up to my path the value of the new done that automated are all going to be caught with you told me that you're going to get pushed up all the way so so because of that but we need to have what is that mean you can't have settings where we don't have any intersections between the enter was because we know if this if this were to be dark tomorrow pass the value on the snow should have been the same as the same as a value you don't have any interest in no way that they would have the same value and no before that to be the ultimate that's kinda refund and it works because your going to have the same values so are we actually doing it so the way you do this is we're going to people lower bound and maximum call Daddy s let me so you're going to have a s which is a lower bound IMAX notes so we going to keep track of that you're also going to keep track of BS which is an upper bound find me notes and then if they don't have any intervals we just drop that having Trust so here's an example so that so that we start with the stock note somehow you found out that the stop no should be greater than or equal to somehow I know it should be greater than or equal to 6 so that is my ASL you sex it is it is going to be a lower bound I might not I know the value don't know how you going to be something greater than how we get to the spindles and then we realise that this window should be less than or equal to 8 so you're here play say A to Z you still have some interview after all good right so BS is going to be 7:45 we have an operand on the menu and I told her that proper bandits so the weather value the value is going to be left handed so far so good then somehow found out that 1 is greater than or equal to 3 great courses three should be fine write the greater than or equal to 3 is equal to 6 my ASM disk case I'm going to call this one S3 is it going to snow cos I know I need to be great or Jericho to sleep but like 6 already does the jailbreak I don't need to worry about that to me so that's all and then I realise that's bs for a holidays for is is equal to 5 and what this tells me is that your value should be less than 5 a list and 500 update Western 8 5 and now I don't have any so what that told me is that part is not going to be off tomorrow because there is no internet so we're not going to just one that is going to be doing and would I told me if I can actually you know that horse up three because because that's not going to be I can get Short Street if we have something else same thing in a different way so so yeah so annoying about your 3 because this is already and cold here but we're ignoring the subtree of like I'm not Explorer I need to explore things after the three already because I like the three of you already had an overlap with the so you're looking with you're looking at the overlap between your upper I've been out and about that into centre volume Brimsdown if you use you don't have me on tube I'm not talk I'm not showing you for example here so the actual values are coming from somewhere but I'm not talking about are the one I the top I get also so the what are the top right so this is a note minute my minnows I found out the minimum between 3 and 5 is 3 so Max note is maximizing between 3 and going to water lights wireless what is maximizing between 3 and butter butter things that it's at least going to be free it's not going to be there's no way for it to be too it's not going to be 0 because it's going to take maximum of 3 and something that's why I'm telling you this now you whatever I'm going to get the snacks now it's going to be graded on so now I come down here and I see you I see this too this is my note the value here is going to be the minimum between two and whatever is down the street so is going to be at least writing to order so what you're getting here is going to be two or lower I'm going to get to 1 or 0 or and that's the value that's going to be pushed up here that's the value that's going to go down here it's going to be a value that is 2 or lower so if I'm 3 and something that is 2 or lower three is enough and I kind of figured that are based on his intervals and don't like once I have I seen this too I already feel like there is no no trivial interval between a value that is greater than 3 and a value that is less than 2 so I can just not worry about rx0 1 quick other implementation thing we talked about this a values and devalue only one value and I would be this alphabet you and about you value map of s is the max of as or are these S5 letter is enough so so so so what does basically said that's already included that kind of the same idea is just going to be 1w in this case is just going to be sick because like I say three like I don't really care about that 9 gallon greater than 3 is not adding anything so we keep track of one value of Earth half of us is just I think you're bigger we're going to keep track of and this is just a minimum of BSS and the ordering of the notes that made a mess and then you're looking at the inter V like off of s alphabet and it flows into the walls don't have TV ultra sections that you can you can dwarven open commendation thing instead of keeping track of all these as is a just keep one number one hour alright what's the time on 1-hour example so I'm going to go quick ok so you're gonna start from some top note we're going to go to this note this is a 0 between 9 and 7 between 9 and 7 I'm going to get this by 7 I'm going to realise that the snacks no it's going to be something that's at least 7 it's going to be something that's greater than or equal to set so my alpha verse is going to be 7 right now I know what about you I'm going to get is going to be 7 or whatever value disturb mode is going to get it's gotta be 7 so now I come down here I'm on a big nose ICA 6-year I go here to me now so whatever yes here is going to be this Tenerife or 26 so it's going to be 6 or something that is lower that tells me my date of birth is equal to 6 that tells me whatever I'm getting in that mean no this going to be 6 in law dad doesn't have any restrictions so I can just not do anything like this this plant I don't need to I don't need to go away you know what you're all these things like I can kind of like ignore this whole alright so now I go back up I go down here and a minute so remember the way by Computing the values were based on the notes of you've seen previously so I have a new bed and because I'm done with this branch right so I need to get here here I have a min between when is it 8 dysentery ok so oh dear it's a minion so it's going to be less than or equal to 8 so my new baby about you is going to be 8 Stihl 74 my top note 8 allure you have an interval overlapping YouTube 0728 everything is good so I actually need to go and see what this now use this Allestree so I did 3 Hero so that update my Peter from 8 the 314 that follows between anyways but 3 you don't have an interview if there were a bunch of things below this tree like I would like to explore it but we don't have and then you just wine that are often well used so we just returned I need an expert the strides made of heart of the tree OK one more slide in quick things actually mad so the only thing I wanna mention that the saviour pruning is is order of things that so so when you look at this example we didn't ask for anything about the 10 because we already knew that this value needs to be greater than who's on my back X-ray stop order buckets I move the 210 bike out of the side 350 of the outside I wouldn't be able to do I told me to explore the poetry because my iPhone badoes wouldn't have the same proper the order that you're putting things on the tree actually matters and about so what's a scenario or ordering a terrible so when you actually go over the 43 that's order of you that's the worst case scenario there is a bit best ordering where you don't explore like half of it so so you can do it if you had if you if you had a tree or your internet up to like the pen that with the best ordering you can actually explore up to Netflix that's a huge improvement the best ordering is going to be order of B2 the d and then random ordering turns out to be pretty ok to say random ordering would be order of be to the 2 x 3/4 so even if you had the random ordering it would be better than the worst case scenario I don't know how do you figure out what is a good bordering ordering we can have this evaluation function and your computing go evaluation function and then what you can do it you can order your search overmax knows you can order the successor is by decreasing evaluation function and therefore menos to can order successes by increasing Italia that allows you to pronounce much things alright so we're not ceedays next auction packing material
