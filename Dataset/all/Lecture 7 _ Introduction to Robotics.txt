this presentation is delivered by the Stanford centre for professional development ok let's get started so today segment come on interesting this this is really an interesting development in 99 Robert playing volleyball and this was developed by a company the shipper Wishaw which is remarkable so robot in games and competition beachball Valley playing over Japan YouTube robots are going to work in your houses and hospitals with humans is developed a beachbar Valley playing rogue is a demonstration of such a human friendly robot technology we consider that it is essential to interact with robot using everyday words such as let's play Valley what do everyday word commands to work the robot needs to middle of targets relative position with respect to the robot position the northern mechanics in procedures of the tasks you do have a good database for the in the tank Wigan rated sensor feedback technology we have demonstrated a row which can play beach ball Valley with no point pick up a ball from the floor and shake hands with I only one respected everyday world come out the robot uses to hit Mount CCTV cameras to the packet bar position in every 168cm the cameras always tractable the op commands the robot to pick up the Red Bull robot starts the search for the Red Bar on the floor after finding the It Moves above the Red Bar then you chips vulnerable make a plan to pick up the bar when the robot finds that the arrangement is too difficult to pick up the red push the green ball inside Intex Dybala rangement again then it picks up the Red Bull wheels virtual server control at the rate of 160 cm to achieve this picking up motion this is the robot view after pushing aside the Green Bar the robot checks the arrangement again approaches the redbone by using the visual server control also the show the human friendliness of the robot chickens with a human it has a tactile sensor in its right the start Hampshire it also has a 6 degree of freedom Force sensor it's rich do Ridley respond to the underlay see you ok sure who was shaking the hands that human shaking the hands of the robot or the rubber chicken pencil the human I wonder if you know why this whole environment is white I mean the Vision is working picking the colour using colour you can go fast so so what is the challenge here colour environment possibly the state of bluebells what is the challenging problem in this demonstration what was the most difficult part in the civilisation reception dad and crack in the wall it's very important because you have to predict where you're going to hit by the way students from this class last year what on a project in experimental robotics to replicate this with the form and it was a lot of fun so you have the camera in your you're checking the wall you need to predict where the wall it's going to be and then you're you place it because your arm is not going to to be positioned correctly with the right orientation unless you do that predict and this is how human work human do a lot of predict I mean the feedback is really slow but the prediction ISM and that's how you can do it there are also other aspect of the problem they were talking about the grasping wishes a very simplistic problem in here because they are using ready to hunt gripper for a large object to the grasping part but it was remarkable in 1990 managed to do that was so quiet 90 798 Honda came with asthma and that was another big achievement in robotics getting a robot walk upstairs down we will get the back about this later it is it was the time when suddenly just before the turn of the century we started to see all these results coming from the maturing of technology that work ringing Vision good mechatronic integration 22 micro what's faster to do task like walking a Staveley and also performing dynamic skills hitting the wall ok the jacobian again well today we're going to be able to look at a mechanism like this one and Psijic Order I promised you you will take a look at the robot and you'll see the check again we're going to do it and like in few minutes you will see like all the colours coming in place and everything stop this is the explicit form of the jacobian last week we saw a messy complicated way of looking at the jacobian or extracting the jacobian by propagating velocities from the base to the interfactor Computing the total linear and angular velocities as a function of the joint velocities because of Lee and then by doing this competition you have you have the expression of the accordion somewhere where embedded in that final answer if your linear velocity and angular so if you separated the the joint velocities you will find are the element of your record but you don't have any idea about exactly what is the structure of the jacobian Matrix what would make it really singular how how the mechanism joint axis angular velocity and linear velocity so now what we going to do is we going to go to each of the joint tax is maddock overload and analyse it's in on both linear velocity and angular vase and by doing this analysis we are going to be able to immediately see how this joint access are going to map to the Jacobi in which column in which way and then basically we can do the reverse we look at the joint access and we will see the solicitors ouigo let's start with a joint pick a joint this one it's pink so drawing the vector Omega I representing the angular velocity generated by Q dot so the direction of PewDiePie is along this vector and it's magnitude is proportional to theta that ok so this is basically stated that VI wish we are calling omega to be to spend all the degrees of freedom we need another joint that is prismatic and I think we have one over there prismatic joint so let's take well will come later so we go are writing what is omega I and here is the prismatic joint this prismatic joint is a long joint access J so along zj n the velocity and measuring is this capital Vijay which is proportional to what it is proportional to d J d is the valuable prismatic valuable along the axes zj so the prismatic velocity for joint I we could buy VI is Zi cu Zi in the case of prismatic who.is Deedat and in the case of revolut it is hater but you remember the episode 1 I now the question that we we should answer is the following if you go to the end of act so let's go to the end effector and say I'm interested in computing the impact of the linear velocity on the linear velocity that revolut joint and dart prismatic so I'm going to put prismatic joint and roll a joint and we are forming the stable so understable the question is what is the contribution a prismatic joint moving at velocity V J on the linear velocity at the end of you see the end effector point is right hip so at this point what if I have everything is still if I just have VJ what would be the factor linear so we need to answer that question men we will place it here I'm sure everyone now is looking at the nose don't look recipe and then we're going to find the impact on Angela think about it this joint is translating with this velocity what would be the linear velocity due to VJ not all at the same time anyone ok Google what is the impact on the linear and angular follow no so the VJ is transformed directly to the in fact and we will find the Basmati joined will have a contribution on the linear velocity identical to the prismatic joint velocity along the same direction on the angular velocity A linear velocity will not change the English motion of the intercostal there will be no and I'm not going to hit the return because I'm afraid that I will we will save a solicitor think about revolut I don't remember that so now it's little bit more complicated but remember that that is we are going to look at the effect of this mega I at the end what is the linear velocity do uniquely omega Fell you remember the Apple so what information we need we need to locate the interfax.ru point distance from phone Direct we really need to find to introduce a vector that connect joint I to the end of fact we will call it pin connect the origin of frame to the origin of Premier so let's make sure the non is perfect under oven we do this connection now we need to compute the linear velocity due to make AI so that is going to be dating and you have the factor how many capital.in your velocity CrossFit that's not enough you have to possibility Omega gospel everyone agrees so Omega I cross pin gives you the contribution revolut joint I on the end of factory linear ok what's about Angela VOL we said the angular velocity is not affected by the prismatic is it affected by the route what is the contribution Omega eye itself so if we have a religion the total I'm going to Halton is going to be the sum of all the Omega eyes and everyone is going to contribute with the same angular policy now the total angular velocity you you walk through you take your Epsilon I and following the time prismatic core overload you can compute the total and girls so if we had a prismatic robot with prismatic joints only what would be the total linear velocity we call it V the total linear velocity is going to be equal the sun from I = 1 to n with Epsilon I need to to use something like you done Epsilon Epsilon I was equal to 1 for prizmatic and equal to 0 for revolut so some I from 1 to n absolute I what was managers come on V12 V and right the can you read it without summer is it a song or a bar 5 VI if we had joined only the linear velocity with b ok someone else I think from this time someone was trying to answer anyone you will try to answer ok I have a religion and I have does joint starting from 12 what is the total velocity due to distribution Whitby would be the sum of all of these from 1 to n but I'm just looking for the absolute some from article 12 N very good x if we have mixed joints in the linear velocity will be Epsilon I VI or Epsilon iBar Omega I yes is there a when it's revenue in so this absalom is equal to one for Christmas and equal to 0 revolut join and if someone born is the complement of EPS wish me that this would be equal to 1 if the joint is prismatic this with the Zara or this would be 0 and then that would be one either one or the other ok now what about the total the total angular velocity is it going to be if I have prismatic joint if we have a joint you use Epsilon I x play zero music Epsilon zero so only apologise welcome tribute and that means Omega is equal to the song from 12n Epsilon ibors all this Omega axe so so Omega is just this x ok alright so here is Omega and V so here so over there you have V the total linear velocity and Omega the total angular now I don't know if you'll see the jacobian but we're not far with very close how do we go so now we have an expression for V and expression for Omega and the question is how can we extractor Jacobi what is the jacobian doing The jacobian Matrix is defined as the metric that kudos to V and Omega so you have to part in this matrix JV and J omega JV is the matter let's connect V2 cute right end J Omega connect omega2 Q dance the question is how we go from here defining JV and J omega video could you help what do we need to do right now I'm expressing V as a function of VI and Omega Omega as a function of omega what do we need to do yes ok so the IQ that as well and if we do that then we will have an expression here and expression here that is linear on kudos this is a song from q1 to Tudor and basically you are just moving through the columns of the jacobian so we substitute indus expression VI with Z iq-ai with ciq Dad and if we do this what's going to have I'm going here to substitute this with Z IQ I and there with CID let's do it come on magic now when do we have here I have cubed I the same but depending on the type of the joint vaginas prismatic I'm using CI and if the joint is revolut I'm using z i Cross I N and here if the joint is Travelodge I have some please here let's say start with the simplest form so the simplest is this one and my question is what is the first column the jacobian m J omega so this is will be the date on this is at some right so J omega the first column of J Omega robot whose first joint is revolut ok I hear 01 I hear 0 Zoey 101 0 everywhere the horsepower of a robot that is first joint is between busy 14 joma what would be the first column of JV for that Simran I have to go up here any volunteer you must be one Excel so if the first chart is revolut with B1 1NN connecting joint 12 turn down my robot is completely prismatic could you tell me what is JV so the first column would be 0 second timer isn't life beautiful Z3 Z4 what about J Omega for a robot that is computer overload the London will it be any simpler I think now you will start to see if we take this expression and really expand this is what is happy V is now a linear combination of the joint velocity is going from the first to the end and now if you take the coefficient of loss cures you can write your JV njv is saying that if the joint is prismatic the column is just to see the zodiac and if the changes are below it's the cross product between that with the vector connecting the joint to benefit and if we spend the second expression we are just looking at revolut jobs prismatic robot will have 0 columns and a risotto but will have all its columns so between b all this as just z-axis so it is your riding 0z ok right well basically this is this is it now you combined with two J v&j omega and you get to Jacobi so this reclusive company competition we were doing as we propagated and we computed the velocities and went with his frame and make sure that the frame the expression is done in the same frame and transform it back to the 04 all of this now is written here explicitly so you have this explicit form that is actually not expecting any friend we said the jacobian this jacobian J omega is function of Z1 Z2 Z3 we didn't say in which frame if you decide now about the frame we have to decide where we Express the vector right so when we express Factors we have text message icovia and I given frame 0 all the factors has to be inflamed 0 all the columns over there you are doing cross-product competition will be cross further competition should be done in the same frame it could be friends 72 and then you have to transform it to the same frame where you're expressing your match so you can do it in a frame to for instance and then take it back to frame so this is a very general form expressing the jacobian in a vector form and then the question is where are you going to need your checking competition and you do that competition by expressing all the factors in that frame this jacobian wishes JV and J omega can be also simplify further if you already computed you are hurricane Nevada because JV if you remember JV is related to the linear velocity so if I'm using speaker coordinates I cannot just different shh free coordinates and linear velocity but if I'm using Cartesian coordinates then basically I can directly differentiate that fact and obtain JV so if you have x y and z computed Audi where can we find x y and z Interflora kinematics where where can we find it in which column in the first column and you get x y and z of the point is Express in some frame you can take the differentiation of that and your jacobian matrix if this vector was Express in frame 0 the position XP now x x y and z of the interactive then you are taking the differentiation with respect to q1 Q2 2QN and that is also your your Jacobi associated with linear motion and this decoration by ventricle to the one computed from Z1 cross P1 N1 B1 a beetle into the last so again there is no commitment yet well experience Express so to go to a frame what is important is to make sure that everything in relation to all these factors describing the jacobian is expressed in the same so this is a vector representation of the Jacobi if we go from The Machinist transformation if we computed the homogeneous transformation we should be able to do this competition immediately so what's your have your images transformation you should be able to extract your 010220 and XP and just to do the simple differentiation and find your chicken now most of the time we Express the jacobian in frames there cm0 this would be simply expressing all these factors influenza well it could be friend it could be maybe sometimes you need it to in frame and for some task and you went to transfer money to Friends air so we need to understand also the relationship between the jacobian in different France bed lifts first look at this vector end for these factors the information about Zi in frames are interested in z7 in frame 0 so where can I find this information for sizing so VIII as the factor of frame I Zi in frame by is equal to what zero zero what so Nez in its all frame is going to be 001 how can how can you find where is 01 and transformer to French what are we going to use I'm sorry I cannot hear very well so we touch formation from trim I frame 0 which transformation you want location you rotate you take the rotation Matrix 3 by 3 wishes indominus transformation so you take the rotation from frame to frame 0 and you can compute your Zi in French so so VI in free my is always constant right so we couldn't see I mean this is the Civic 2001 and as you said we take it from frame I do friends or a which means that is essentially we need to multiply multiply 001 by the rotation matrix from frame to frame Sarah what does it mean to think now about this 3 by 3 rotation metre and you are most playing the rotation matrix by 001 what are you doing there what is the result if you want to fly the 3 by 3 matrix by 001 you are picking the last call so basically this information is found in the rotation Matrix in the third column of the rotation matrix 120 20 20 N20 4 the revolutions ok so so now we have this phone and we are going to try to apply to our relatively complicated the Stanford seminar end and Wednesday I will bring it in the lab so you can see it and we can look at the some of the properties related to the singularities and dos access and the you can see the prismatic rely on the picture so you still have to imagine the robot end but I want you to do is to casino the jacobian can you see it no maybe if I give you a drawing of it it will it will be better before that let's go and summarise what we have we said the computer V and Omega we computers Jacoby from its two-component JV the block JV and the block J omega vy JVC connecting Q Duck TV and omega omega connecting shooter to make and the first car I'm in the first block JV is neither Zi vagina or the cross product of the eye with the vector I N ok the Omega and the J Omega is simply the Zi vectors corresponding to religion so you see this week because now I'm going to ask you to to give me to give me the jacobian for this robot and this is the schematic of the robot and you can see here the jacobian is empty you need to fill and I hope you're not looking at your nose or you don't have it stop let's see if anyone sees what should goes here no you have to match it with the with the joint of the robot and there do you understand those pipes here joint one is volluto prismatic revolut s answered and then the rest is rude here we go here 01 ok here zito Z3 I heard lately you said 0 0 0 45 and what about this one first one it's a religion the first one is 0 revolute joint it is V1 Cross 1 or is 0 because they are confident with B12 n in this case any is that green frame it is on frame free so really 223 what about this one so 123 223 stream sign up to see it's going to be selling the frame additional free for this competition we said we will do the competition at the racetrack wishes the frame in this case it turned out to be the frame number 3 identity of the origin of 3 is identical to Ford 5 and 6 the same the same so this one would busy to cross 23 and here v30 so you have Z1 Z2 03 it pushes up goes up busy speakers up and you can see when you have a reading joined you you're getting a zero otherwise you have the revolut so let's check C3 so the next game is going to be 0 because now we are measuring the distance from 3 to 4 it's the same point yes all these weather presenter ok this is very important if you if we don't know the Z axis I computers what just one second let's go back so the z-axis is the joint axis itself a long wish we are having this rotation and this is the when we go to to the frame themselves like when we go here this is 0 and if you remember there was the one attached to frame 1 ze2 we are sitting here this so these are the z-axis long rejoin tax and was all the disease that we are talking about and we are measuring the rotation about the Z axis and we are measuring the prismatic motion of the linear motion along the prismatic joint Zi so when we were computing prismatic joint 3 the motion along along which direction is coming from Longbridge everyone says this is important if you don't see the access you have Zoey 0013 it's already influenza Rhodes it's whatever it is Z3 in frame free 001 and this is what we call Daisy and what we saw is that we when we go and Express this in frame 0 we need to transform this vector to friend 0 as well as all the factors should be expressed in friends are ok now why do we have zero here permission BZ what for Crosbie 43 I'm in basically we're going to that that same point which is 0 so here 0 and here there are here we said we have 010220 Z4 5 and 6 ok alright can you really feel what is happening on this record compared to your mechanism do you understand it although we are in the same frame the origin of the same point mutations are going to add so there is columns for the Omega for the linear velocity there is no effect of joining cu.ft 5 and 6 on the linear velocity angular velocity it is there rotations are described directly by the z-axis of the chance and when you x qubit to computer V and Omega you are multiplying here by cute at 1 tutor2u good apps free 45 and 6 ok yes office nt1 cross 16 if we called this the end of fracture frame in French sexual it will be and if it was another thing 7 at the end of factory it could be I just tried here knowing for 5 about 3 is the same point as all the following Orange ok now we're going to do this computer now we're going to find this matter end so maybe that's what it was doing just like thank you how can I turn it off I think it's like suffering trying to update something and it must do it every time I have left I think the camera just like looks and find me and look at the black and white and just his here so let's do it now heard so it's quite simple but please pay attention now I'm going to show you how we can start from the beginning right after you did your friend sign and computer vote for kinematics and you take opium in one shop let's let's go walkthrough so we know how to do this right you did the homework and you know how to do and this is due to occur right over there I'm going to you D2 D3 and we are going to use Volkswagen and where are you going to express our transformation as a function of data heater to GU34 5 and 6 which are the cubes so what we are going to do from here we are going to computer the homogeneous transformation every rose correspond to homogeneous transformation that is computer from this expressions going from 3 - 12 frame this is I an now I'm going to write it down so when we computed all of these we do this multiplication and we find the forward transformation from frame and to frame Sarah ok no the way you do this competition the steps you're going to take all very important in order to clean your jacobian in a given frame at the same time as you're doing your forward kinematic so this the transformation from frame 120 21 322 these are coming directly from the phone you're not doing any multiplication you're getting 120 from the role first road second row to draw Force Faith ok stop I'm just applying a formula to all the days farmer and if we had another frame attached to the end effector they will be 726 and that one will be con it will not be depending on any job so here's what we're going to do if we are going to express our jacobian and this is what we do most of the time in French because we would like to find our velocities in Friends so what are we going to meet we need we are going to need all the vectors in frame so in particular we need the Zi vectors in French which means we need the rotation of the rotation Matrix vector that tickets from frame.io to friends so for the first Z Z1 influenza is where the one in French 0 is right here it 001 so when I do this competition I will computer 220 by multiplying 2 to 1 my 120 I get to 20 and that gives me Z 2 in French 0 what is y tu in French 0 from here minus sine 1 cosine 1 and 0 and this is the three in frame so these are very important in computing digital but also are going to be needed when I'm doing the multiplication I always phone from i20 I will computer 3 to 1 and then x 320 I will be wasting too much time I will go 102030405060708090100 this way you are getting directly all the doctors in Friends you can do this for all of them and this is the last one this is what V6 in French ok so where is your jacobian basically we have it it is already here in the emergence of formation DJ omega J Omega 6 fifth column fourth column search second fiscal actually the third is 0 but this is the is needed in the top of JP so it's what you got up yes ok where we getting to the pictures ok so the J Omegas are already there all the cup and if the robot is prismatic the same thing we have jacobian JV yes daytime night x 31 stop the 100 you are going to need you are going to need the final transformation to confuse the orientation of the robot so you need this column and this column for the description of the orientation for the for kinematics so you need to do the multiplication but what I'm saying is do x starting from you you start from you have 10 but then you have to 21 3 tattoo do not do not walk by multiplying from this size 32 by 21 x 120 you multiply 2000 I mean your ST220 from 21 x 10 and now you use this mattress x the next one you go from 3 to 0 and this way you have this intermediate competitions that are going to be needed in addition to your you you still need the final the final matrix because this is your homogeneous transform any questions about this is just to make sure that you have its intermediate vectors Express in France area off the computer is it from - 1 to 100 why I said it is a mistake with every year I have it wasn't honest from long time ago you think no it's correct I think Eric so now what are you saying is as you computer homogeneous transformation make sure that you have those intermediate factors that you will need for the Jacobi now ok are you still with me your attention look at the last call look at the Roscommon in this transformation and compared to the previous one to the previous one identical right do you know why what's the temperature so actually this is the same we have here when we released friend please infer where is the factor of 1 ok so the question is how are we going to compute now as we go through this how long are we going to computer Davy well if we go and computer Jovi we have two ways of doing this either by Computing the vector p from 1 2n and Express it in French 0 or the frame where Z is expressed or as I said what what this represents x y and z the Cartesian coordinates so you have already the Cartesian co-ordinate in your home maginess transformation so actually you don't need to compute the p you just different sheet this and Express your JV as a function of the parcel delivered xy&z with respect to Q you get the first column Q2 second column so just to check if you are following what I'm saying could you give me we are on the 1st first vector of the jacobian JV and I would like to find the third element of the first Call turn alarm of the first column of the of the jacobian JV so what are you differentiating it gets user and the first element what did the French dating the first one and s ok what is the sitcom of JV it's different C1 S2 S1 S2 MC2 ok can you check whether this your answer is correct independently yes Is This It because this is a prismatic joint joint it should be identical to the Z3 which is here so when you're different shape with respect to D3 you've been this call you see that because what competitions or should give you the same answer so the third column we know the system is Simply Be Free but if you still differentiate you get the free ok now you trusted so so basically this competition of the jacobian is already in your home address confirmation you are computing at the same time your computing your forward kinematic x y and z and all what you need to do is to extract yours effectors in the appropriate frames and failure jacobian and for the JV party are going to use this differentiation and you have your Jacob so the jacobian Matrix 4 the Simon Stamford Sharman arm where's you computed your homogeneous transformation from France 620 you have your phone coronavirus in here you have xy&z in here you have the rotation so you have Direction cosines you have all the description you are you have your Direction cosines x y and z Direction cosines first column second column to comma and now you can take the intermediate steps where you computer the the eyes to fill your jacobian mate and is it is here yes the first of course with differentiated wee differentiated this expression with respect to q1 this is this is the first element 11 the in the first column second element is differentiation of this with respect to 1 and this with the Spectre one so what are taking x y and z and differentiating with respect to q and that will give you the first Call this column corresponds to the contribution of gentle and so you differentiate with respect to q1 this column is the contribution of join to you differentiate with respect to pewter the third column is Widnes back to Q3 or because this is a prismatic joint this could be 15 directly from Z3 in French yes this xp50 what colour e06 this is the first hall of 06 in here so if you if you and you managed to read this you lived in the same time XP is copied from x y and z in homogeneous transformation if we are selecting if we are selecting contagion could ok q1 there is no there's no light when in the first expression otherwise it will be a problem because we have C1 so what is C1 maybe maybe the confusion is that you don't see the dependency on q110 1 and S1 what does it mean C1 and S1 I'm ok help me funny quotes wedding what is C1 QR call sign huion for joints which is revolut which means cosine theta one the valuable data one so q1 is in the cosine 1 and C1 means cosine the angle q1 so when we differentiate C1 with respect to q1 what do we get if we just differentiate differentiate this first element first how long was the first car your definition with respect to q1 are you there with me are you there with me the first I wanna put this back to you on now what's the weather so you do a shape with respect to q1 and you have someone that would be 1 add time 1 everyone I'm sending this probably this is maybe not clear S1 with me say S1 E1 S2 C2 where are reference to the variable cuter ok so this is the the Matrix so you see after all it's not that complicated that your cooking is simply is simply this column associated with your Z axis for the lower part related to rotational motion 4oD prismatic joints it is the same axis and for the other joint timing for the linear motion overcharged doing a simple differentiation of u x y and z and that gives you the answer for the jacobian Matrix now w interesting about the discovery of the fact that you can just go and use the mattress without really making sure that you are in the right configurations to perform at because for many the interesting configurations for somebody that's why how problems like the singularity you are going to not be able to know about some access you are locally going to lose the ability of rotational motion for about some of the access depending on that computer so there is the notion of kinematic singularity that you can directly examine from this Matrix and no singularities correspondence singularity in into the Matrix itself so if we take a 2 degree framework if we can have the car on my arm please so if you're feeling robot and you are moving now in space in this playing I can move anywhere right instantaneously I can produce any displays but if I move and stretched and stretched to the end of the world space do you notice anything now I cannot move a longest axis so the actors could be like this or labels that I cannot move instantaneous to along this axis that is no displacement doubt potato dr2 that produces a component in the direction and this is a singularity what happened in this configuration is the fact that now the two columns of your jacobian matrix became dependent so when does Collins become dependent you are going to lose rank the metric is not full rank this mattress is 6 by 6 we like it when it is falling but if two cars become independent immediately you lose rank and you lose the Freedom to move what is the I will bring the Staffordshire men on here and will be able to examine another type of singularity related to the wrist point and the fact that joint for and during sex when they are aligned you'll is the ability to rotate about this axe and that makes it really hard to put 4motion indus locations not only in the vocations but also ramification the Prado singularity is that when you come closer to singularity the matchworks become becomes is condition Limerick Leader still condition if you want to compute the inverse going to give you NAS number and that is if you want to do a small displacement in Dota you will need a large displacement in delta Q to produce this so we'll examine this and we will talk about the kinematic singularity see you then
