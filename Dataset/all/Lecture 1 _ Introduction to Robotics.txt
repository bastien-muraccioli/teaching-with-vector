this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development ok get started welcome to intro robotics 2008 well happy new year so in introduction to robotics we are going to really cover the foundations of robotics that is we are going to look at the mathematical models that represents robotic systems in many different ways and in fact you just saw those in class you saw a simulation of a humanoid robotic system that we are controlling at the same time and if you think about a model that you are going to use for the simulation you need you need really to represent the kinematics of the system you need also to be able to actuate the system by going to the Motors and finding the right the robots movie so let's go back to the it's quite interesting so so here is a robot you would like to control and the question is how can we really come up with a way of controlling the hands to move from one location to another and if you think about this problem there are many different ways in fact and controlling the robot first of all you need to know where the robot is and to know where the robot is uni HomeSense what kind of sensors you would have on the to know whether overseas an idea GPS well alright how many how many how many parameters you can measure with GPS that's fine we can try that how many what can you determine with GP you will locate a X and Y for the location of the GPS how many degrees of freedom how many bunnies are moving when I'm moving this like like here how many videos are movie how many GPs do you want to put you will need about 247 if you have 47 degrees of freedom and that once were to expensive another idea we need something incur incur incur this measures 1 degree of freedom of the angle and how many quarters we need for 47 degrees of freedom 47 now that will give you the relative position but we will not know whether this configuration is here so you need a GPS to maybe locate one object and then locate everything with this if you if you any other idea to locate yeah by integrating a from an initial known position or or using vision systems at least one or two objects then you know where will the robot is and the relative positions of velocities could be determined as women so once we located the robot then we need to 22 somehow find a way to describe a weird things arceaux where is the right hand with the left-hand where so you need the what do you need there you need to find the relationship between all this Richard but is so that once the robot is standing you know where to position with the armies will the handle will the headers so you need something that comes from the science of well I'm not f****** now about senses we know the information but we need to determine amavel the kinematic model basically need the kinematics and when the thing is moving generates Dynamics fight so you need to find the national forces you need to know so if your mother right hand suddenly everything is moving right you have coupling between this Richard but it's that are let's connect so we need the to find the day night and once you have all this model then you need to think about a way to control the room so how do we control a robot like this seletti I would like to move this to hear how can we do that the hand I would like to move it order inverse kinematics well the forward kinematics gives you the location of the hand the inverse kinematics give you given a position for behind that you desire you you need to you will be able to solve what joint angles and if you do that then you'll know your goal position angle for each of the job then you can control this joints to move to the appropriate positions and the arm will move to that well can you do inverse kinematics for this robot it's not easy it's already difficult for 6 degree of freedom robot like an arm bed for our Robert with many degrees of freedom so suppose I would like to move to this location location here there are infinite ways I can move there and there are many many different solutions to this problem in addition human do not really do it this way I mean when you moving your hand do you do inverse kinematics ne so so we will see different ways of I would come back to the solicitor later b I'm not sure why diarrhoea robots is basically was captured by this image that is you have a robot working in an isolated environment in a manufacturing plant doing things speaking we can place moving from one location to another without any interaction with humans but robotics over the years evolved in today robot is in many different areas of application from robots working with a surgeon to operate a human-robot assisting a worker to carry a heavy load two robots in entertainment robots in many many different Fields and this is what is really exciting about robotic the fact that for particles getting closer and closer to the hue that is we are using the robot now to carry to lift to work to extend the hands of the humour so happy can't erection you can feel a virtual environment or a real involve I don't not sure if everyone knows what is haptics haptics comes from the sun a Greek word that describes the sense of touch end from hat so here is the hands of the surgeon and the surgeon is still operating he's operating from outside but essentially the the robot is inserted and instead of opening the body we have a small incisions through which we introduced the robot and then we do the operation and the recovery is amazing few few days of recovery and the patient is out of the hospital operation to have sticks or through master devices allow us to control to the heaters the surgeon working faraway operating or operating under water or interacting with a physical environment in Home Store in the factory another interesting thing about robotics is that because automatics Focuses on articulated by the systems we are able now to use all this marbles all these techniques we developed in robot tomorrow humour and to create sort of and digital model of the human that can as we will see later that can be assimilated and controlled to reproduce actual behaviour capture from a motion capture device about the human behaviour also with this interaction that we are creating with the physical world we are going to be able to use Haptic devices to explore physical walls that are that cannot be touched in reality that is we cannot go to the item level that we can simulate the item level and devices we can explore those world the most exciting area in robotics is producing devices robots that like the human and behave like life animals or human end few years ago I was in Japan anyone knows where this photo is he said awesome very much that you are cheating because he was so this is from Yokohama and the new comedy is rubber ducks 1010 of people to see all the latest in robotics this was few years ago and you could see Arsenal here isomer which is really the latest in a series of otunga following feature and the p30 robot Endon and edition you could see well that the most of the major players in robotics in humanity anyone have seen this one do you know this one this is the Sony robot that that's actually I think I have a video let's see if it works the Sony is balancing on moving bar and the this is not an easy to and you can imagine the requirements in real-time control in dynamic modelling and the aspect of the and this was accomplished few years ago well actually this robot here to stand for the few years ago and they did performance herein it was quite exciting to see this well but dancing and performing there are a lot of four different robots especially in Asia Japan and Korea humanoid robots are built a series of robots HRP or P12 and they are building and developing a more capabilities for those robots 1 of 10 one of the interesting interesting sure that we had the recently was near during the World Expo in aichi and they demonstrated a number of some of them mainly came from research Laboratories that collaborated with the industry to build those machines this is a dancing robot let's see this is HRT so HRP is walking walking is now remastered that the problem is how can you move do a position take an and control the interaction with the physical world this is merchandising received it sliding and patching is not plenty Macedonia this is the direction of research in this area this is an interesting device that come from w other University this robot has additional degrees of freedom that ok another problem now so you have additional degrees of freedom in the hip joints to allow our two to move little bit more like a human let's see how this is one of my favourite this is human-like and human-like actuation in it so artificial muscle that are used to create a the motion but obviously you have a lot of problems when artificial muscles because they Nanak response is very slow and the power that you can bring it we will talk about Dorset shoes as well ok let me know what you think about does that a good sign so so what do you think do you need the robots to really have the perfect appearance of human or like we need the functionalities of the environment like if we are working in with a tree as we we we we specialise the rubber to cut trees if we are working in the human environment then we will have a robot has the functionalities of the mobility division so this are really interesting issues to think about whether we need to have the robot biologically based or functionally based in and how we can clear those interactions in an effective way last one I think it's a this is an interesting example of 4 how we can extend the capabilities of human with an exhaust Colyton so you wear it and you'll become a Superman or Superwoman and you can carry heavy load they will demonstrate here caring I believe 60 kg without feeling any any weight because everything is sticking by the structure of the skeletal system you are wearing another interesting one is this one from technology a swimming robot make sure no water gets into the motor the think it is robotics is getting closer and closer to the human Andaz we see robots getting closer to the human we are facing a lot of challenges in in Rayleigh making this machines work in the unstructured messy environment of the when we were working with the robots in structured manufacturing plans the problems work much simpler now you need to deal with many issues including the five that you need safe you need safety to create that interaction and this distance between the human and the robot is very well Justified you don't worry yes to bring the rabbit the very close to the human because this machines or not quite sick well development in robotics is has many aspects and many forms and really at Stanford we are fortunate to have a large number of classes courses offered different areas of robotics graphics and computational geometry haptics and the all of these things and you have a list the different courses offered are all along the year and impact in my this is the intro to robotics in spring I will be afraid to additional course that would deal with experimental robotics that is applying everything you have learn during this class 20 about and experimenting with the robe as well as exploring advanced topics in research and this is in advanced robotics so you realise I'm over your instructor and you have this year we are lucky we have three helping with the class eat a Christina and shining so let's they are over here pissed and I've just seen your face is so they will become nice you and the office are also listed so we will have office hours for me on Monday and Wednesday and Monday Tuesday and Thursday for the th the lecture notes are here and they are available at the bookstore this is the 2008 edition so we keep improving it it's not yet a textbook but it is quite complete intern the requirement of the things you need the to do have for the class so let's see the schedule so we are today on Wednesday the 9th and we will go to the final examination on March the 21st bear are few changes in the schedule from the handout you have and the we will update this later there is this changes happen just in this area here around around the Dynamics and control schedule better exactly what we're going to do starting next week is to start covering the marble so we will start with the spatial descriptions we go to the forward kinematics and we will do the jacobian and I will discuss this little by little and that will take us to the Mitcham one important think about the Meacham and the final is that we will have review session and the class is quite large so we will split the class into and we will have to go that will attend this review sessions will take place in the evening and he will take place in the lab in the robotics lab and during the sessions we will cover the mid-term of past years and the finals of Bastion what is nice about the session that she will have a chance to see some demonstrations of robot and the same while eating pizza and drinking some so so that will happen between 7 and the 9 sometimes it goes to 10 because we have a lot of questions and discussions but these sessions are really really important and I increase you and I am pretty also the remote students 22 to be present for the sessions they are very very helpful in preparing you for the maternal and the final so as I said the this class covers mathematical model that are essential I know some of you might not really like well getting too much into the details of mathematical models that we are going to really have to do it if we or going to try to control this machines or build this machines designed this machines we need to understand the mathematical models The Foundations in Kalamata Andy Nyman and you all then use this model to create controllers and we are going to control motion so we need to plan this mode we need to plan motion that are safe and we need to generate electricity that are small so these are the issue that we need to address in the planning and control in addition to the fact that we need to touch feel interact with the wall so we need to create compliance motions which relying on first control the first control is is critical in creating those interaction and we will see how we can control the robe to move in free space or in contacts space as the robot is interacting with the and then we'll have a some time to discuss some advanced topics just introduced as advanced topics so that those of you who are interested in pursuing research maker maybe plants to take the more advanced courses that will be offered in Spain tell let's go back to the problem I talked about in the beginning is the problem moving this robot from one location to another surprise you would like to move this platform this is a mobile manipulator platform would like to move it from here to here how do we do that well we said essentially what we need to do is somehow find a way discovering a configuration through which the river creatures final goal position and this is one of them you can imagine the robot is going to move to that country the problem with this is the fact that if you have redundancy so what is redundancy redundancy is the fact that you can reach that position with many different configurations because you have more degrees of freedom in the sea and when you have redundancy this problem of inverse kinematics becomes fully difficult problem so but if you forward then you will be able to say I would like to move each other joints from this position this joint position to this jumpers so you can control the robot by controlling it's joint and by creating trajectories for the joints to know and then you will be able to reach that goal position this is not the most natural way of controlling Rob and we will see that there will be different ways of approaching the problem that are much more natural how to control the robot first you need to find Aldi's position and orientation of the of the mechanism itself and that requires us to find descriptions of position and orientation of object in space then we need to deal with the transformation between friends attached to this different because here to know where the centre Factor is you need to know how if you know this position the position of those different object how you transform that description define finally the position of your rental so you need transformations between different planes attached to those so the mechanism is the army in this case is a defined by a that is fixed which is the best and another is it I've learnt that is moving which is which we call the end of that and between these two objects you have all the links that are going to carry the interfactor to move it to someone and the question is how can we describe this matter so we will see that we are using joints different time joints that are revolute prismatic through those descriptions we can describe the link and then we can describe the chain of links connect through set of parameter don't very delivered and hot American students here I stand in the early 70s and talk about this problem and he came up with a set of parameters minimal set of parameters to represent the relationship between two links on a chain and their notation now is basically used everywhere in robotics and through this notation and those parameters we will be able to come up with a description of the forward kinematics the forward is the relationship between these joint angles and the position of the affected so through forward kinematics who can complete where the end effector position and orientation is so these parameters are describing the Common normal distance between 2 axis of rotation and the service distance and also the orientation between this axis and through this we can go through the chain and then attach frame to the different joint and then a find the transformation between the joists in order to find the relationship between the base frame and the interfactor frame so once we have those transformations then we can compute the total transformation so we have local transformation between successive France and we can find the local transformer now when we know the geometry that is we know where the Factor is where is Link is with respect to the other then we can use this information to come up with a description of the second important characteristic in kinematics and this is the velocity how things are how fast things are moving with respect to each other and we need to consider too not only the linear velocity of the defective but also the angular velocity at its rotate and we will examine the different velocities linear velocities angular velocity will wish we will see a duality with the relationships between Force applied and the joint and forces resulting at end of fact horses this is the linear horses are associated with linear motion moment thoughts associated with Angela and the rest of the quality that brings this jacobian the model that release velocity A2B playing tools 12 find the relationships between joint velocities with an effective velocities and one to find the relationship between forces of part of the environment and torque apply to the motor the jacobian plays a very important role and we will spend some time discussing the jacobian and finding ways of obtaining the jacobian so as I said describes this factor the linear velocity and Omega Factor the angular velocity and it relates those velocity is to the joint velocities so the jacobian qubit gives you the linear and angular velocity and we will see that essentially dystopian is really related to the way the axis of this robot or design and once you understand this Marvel you are going to be able to look at the robot and see the jacobian automatically you look at the machine and you see the model automatically through this explicit form that we will David to compute the linear velocity and angular velocity the analysis of the contribution of each axis to the final resulting velocity so we will also discuss the inverse kinematics or we're not going to use it extensively as it has been done in industrial robotics we will use we will examine inverse kinematics and look the difficulties in term of the multiplicity of Solutions and existence and examine the different techniques for finding the solution tell the again the inverse kinematic is how I can find this configuration that correspond to the desired in defective position and Orient and then using the Solutions we can then do this in preparation between where the robot is a given point and then how to move the robot to the final configuration through that are smooth both in velocity and acceleration and other constraints with that we might impose through the generation of trajectories Both In Space and internet stations so this I'm going backwards so this will result in both it's most vegetarians that could have via points that could impose upper bound on the velocities or the acceleration and resolving all of the by finding this interpretation between the different parts and that will bring us to the m which will be on Wednesday February the 15th is not a Friday 13th no worries and it will be in class and will be doing the same schedule for the term the time of the class is short in the you have ready to be ready naturally 222 like to discover how to solve the problem but immediately to work on the problem so that's why the review sessions are very important to prepare you for the meeting to make sure that you will be able to Salvo the problem so we will make sure that the size of the problem fits with the time constraints that we have in the Mitcham after the meeting we will start looking at Dynamics control and the other topics and first what we need to do is too well I'm not assuming I'm not sure how many of you are Mechanical Engineers let's see how many are mechanical engineers in the put end how many LCS wow that is about try to have half of the class was familiar with some of the physical models with that we are going to develop and some others for arm but I'm going to assume that really everyone has no knowledge of dynamic soul Control or kinematics and I will start by with really the basic foundation so you shouldn't worry about the fact that you don't have strong background in indus areas we will cover them from the staff he will go to what is the what is how.did.the with the acceleration and then we will established the Dynamics which is quite simple anyone recalls Newton equation let's see what is what is the what is the relationship between forces and acceleration you need to know that I need to hear it someone this is this is all what you need to know if you know how one particle can move under other application of a force then we will be able to generalise too many particles at past in originally and then we will put them into a structure that will take us to multibody system articulated multi Google Ribble cover bees without difficulty offaly the result is quite interesting so this is a robot this is a robot that is controlled not by motors on the joists but by cable so read the active part of the robot is from here to there and here you see all the Motors and table driven system that that is on the right no if you think about the Dynamics of this robot in destiny really complicated so you'll see on the right here so this is the robot and here you have some of the descriptions of we cannot see anything properly but you you you have all the descriptions of for instance what is the inertia view from the the first junk when you move this is changing as you imagine if I'm considering the inertia Barbossa if I'm replacing the whole arm this will be a natural increase if I'm putting on like this I will have smaller in about this bigger in a small Arena so the configuring the view from a joint is going to depend on the structure following that joy and we will see that it's actually all of this will come a very naturally from the equations that will be generated from the multi-party system that what we're going to use for this is a Vincent full description that again will allow you to take a look at this robot and say oh this is the the the characteristics of the dynamic characteristics of this joint and you can almost see the the coupling forces between the different joints in a visual form that all depend on those axis of rotation and translation of the and this concert through the explicit form of Dynamics that Google this representation is an abstract abstraction of the description that we will do with the with the jacobian so I said in the jacobian case we will take a description that is based on the contribution of HJ to the total velocity and we will do the same thing what is the contribution of each link to the resulting in a selfie so when we do best we will look at what is the contribution of this joint and the apostilling and the contribution of the others and we just Adam or Andy see the structure coming all together that is a very different way then the way Newtown and formalize the Dynamics which relies on the fact that we we take this advice and connect through reaction forces so if you did overlay and if you remove the job you 11 but when you remove the joint you substitute with the removal of the joint with reaction forces and then you can study all these reaction forces and try to find the relationship between forces and acceleration well this way of wishes called the recursive Newton for Malaysia is going to require elimination of this internal forces and elimination of the forces of contact between the different Richard Bell and what we will do instead we will go to the velocity and we was considered the energy associated with with the motion of this so if you have a velocity V and Omega at the centre of mass and you can write the energy the kinetic energy associated with this moving man and inertia associated with the reason and simply by adding the can you take another see of these different lengths you have the total kinetic energy of the system and by then taking these velocities and taking the jacobian relationship between velocities to connect them to joint velocities you will be able to extract the the mass properties of the road so the mathematics will become a very simple form of the jacobian so that's why I'm going to insist on your understanding of the jacobian once you understand the accordion you can scale the jacobian with the masses and the initials and get your dinner so going to dynamic is going to be very simple after the mid term you really understood what is the Jacobi the the Dynamics of this mass matrix associated with the Dynamics of the Sith done simply by looking at the sun the contributions of the centre of mass velocities and the jacobian associated with the centre of in control we will examine or I'm going to assume also that little background in control so we will go over just a single man spring system and analyse it and then we will examine controllers such as PD controllers or pid controllers for personal delivery proportional integral derivative and then we apply these in joint space and in tax pay by augmenting the controllers with with the dynamic structure so that we account for the Dynamics when we are controlling the robot that is going to lead to a very interesting analysis of the Dynamics and how they namics affect the behaviour of the robo and you can see that the equation of motion for two degrees of freedom comes to be sort of two equations involving not only the acceleration of the drive but that's elevation of the second joint the velocities centrifugal coriolis forces and gravity forces and through the all of this world have effective dynamic it affect and disturbances on the behaviour that we will analyse a structure that would allow us to design top 1 and 32 to 30 apply to the motor to create the behaviour that is going to allow us to compensate for this so I love this or descriptions in joints that is descriptions of what torque and what motion at the Joy and what do we will see is that in controlling robe we we can really simplify much further the problem by considering the behaviour of the robot in term of its motion when performing a task that is we can go to the task itself the task in the case of further example I described his how to move the hand to this location without really focusing on how each of the joint is going to move and discounts can be captured by Simply thinking about this robot is Totoro as if the robot was attracted to move to the group position this is similar to the way human operate when you are controlling your hand to move to a good position essentially you are visually suffering your hand to the bow you are not thinking about how the joints army you are just moving the Hand by a flying this forces to move the height of the golfers it's like a holding the Hand and putting it down to the go and the it has the initial configuration you have no commitment about the final configuration of the of the you are applying the first towards the goal and you are moving so simply by creating a gradient of a potential energy will be able to move to configuration and this is precisely what we so in this example in the example of phone this robot here so this motion that we are creating so if we are going to move the hand to this location we are going to generate a 4 that pulls like a magnet it will pull the hand to this configuration but at the same time you have in this complex case you have a robot that is standing and it has to be so there are other things that needs to be taking into account and what we are doing is we are also applying other potential energies to the rest of the body so when we apply this first receipt just following it's like a magnet following this configuration there is no competition of the joint position simply we are applying these attractive forces to the goal can apply it here play there reply to both now Mother's Day if you if you the motorist is going to fall it's a little bit like a human when you cut the muscle infected this environment we developed it's quite interesting you can you can not only interact with it by moving the goal but you can go and pull the hair can't go anywhere a click here and Computing the forward kinematics and the Jacobi and I'm applying a force that is immediately going to produce that first computed by the jacobian on the Motors and everything will Rea in that way so we are able to create those interaction between the graph can you text and apply to the dynamic system and everything I should have some related on the laptop so this is an environment that allows to do a lot of interesting simulation human-like structures Ender so you apply the force and you transform it as I said the relationship between forces and 4 is also a physical being being placed a very important role and then the computer dynamic what we need to do is to understand the relationship between forces of Flight the end effector and the resulting acceleration now when we talked earlier about Newton-le-Willows said for mass acceleration equal Force and the massless scalar but this is my motor buddy sister and the mass is going to be a big and master so relationship between force and acceleration is not linear that is forces an expiration or not a line because of the fact that you have a match and because of that you need to establish the relationship between the two and once you have this model you can account for the dynamics in your forces and then you can align the force to move to be in the direction that produces the right finally we need to deal with the problem controlling so when you are moving in space is 1 but when we are going to move in contacts space it's a different applying this Force put the horse structure under ACL strain and you have you have to account for this country and computer normal skip to find reaction forces in order to control the forces being applied to the environment so we need to deal with first control and we need to stabilise the transition from free space to contacts so that is we need to be able to control this contact forces while moving what is nice if you do this in the Cartesian space or in the task space you will be able to merge the two forces together to control the robot directly to produce motion and confer I mentioned that we will discuss some other topics there will be a guest lecturer that will talk about vision in robotic and we will also discuss issues about design I would like to discuss little some issues related to safety and the issues related to making robots whiter with the structures become safer and flexible l222 work in human invite also we need to to discuss a little bit about motion cleaning and especially if we are going to introduce robot in the human environment within reactive plan and there is this video you can see how a complex robotic system is reacting here 2 two of S that are coming out it's moving away from the subs and this is simply done by using the same type of concept that I described for moving to a girl position I said we can create and an attractive potential and Yoshi in here to create this motion we are creating a repulsive potential so if you put two magnets north north they will repel and this is exactly what is happening we are creating artificially those forces and making the robot and moved away but if you have a global plan you need to deal with the full plan so that you will not reach a local minima and we then apply this technique to modify all the intermediate configuration so that a robot like this with be moving to ago position through this plan and win an obstacle or when the world is changed the trajectory is moving the hangers movie and all of this is happening in real time wish amazing for Robert with bus number of degrees of freedom the reason is I'm not sure if you're familiar with the problem sorry the problem of motion planning in robotics is exponential in the number of degrees of freedom so usually if you want to replant emotion win10 circle has moved it will take and for large number of degrees of Fear and here we are able to do this quite quickly because we are using the structure and we are using the scones off repulsive forces that modifies future configuration and integrate so this is an example showing Indiana Jones going through the obstacle modified by actually modify all these configurations and and all all these conversations are taking place because in real time because we are using the initial structure and incrementally modifying all the configuration another topic that that I mentioned slightly earlier is the implication on digital modelling of human and learning from the human is very interesting and very very attractive to create and a good controllers for robots and also understanding human in fact currently we are modelling motion and the trying to analyse and learn from those most so you can go from motion capture to copying that much into the the robot but in fact you will end up with just one example of May the question really is how you can generalise just have one specific and to do that if you want to July's you need to take the motion of the human from washing capture and Method not the robot but a model of the hue so you need to model the human and modelling the human involved modelling the skeletal system so we worked on this problem so you have this is a new kind of robot system with many degrees of freedom about 79 degrees of freedom and all of this is marble through the same model of kinematics they mama endo and then you can model the actuation wishes muscles now and from this you can learn a lot of things about the model and dino you can control you can control this isn't a size motion and you understand how this is working you just guy the task and then you have the bar taking place through other mini musician of the remaining reminder of degrees of freedom and then then you can take us characteristics and madam to the robots k to the not tapping trajectories but tapping the characteristics of them interest I will discuss on so little bit about 6:30 this will be more developed in advanced robotics later in the spring important especially in the interaction with the environment at the real physical environment you go and touch and now you have information that allows you to record this earth and move over now descriptions of what you are touching and what normals you have oh well contact why did Maisie what is amazing about this is this is done in real time so someone from the industry was visiting us and why model of skeletal system Ender good models for resolving contact why don't you use them for a crash instead of using dummies right so out it's only in the week so well that will come later but I will mention few things about the interactivity also with obstacles and how we can deal with those issues and then combining locomotion walking with manipulation and the dynamic skills like jumping landing and obviously ok so what is happening here this is a different planet I'm going to and that will take us to the final which will be on Friday the 21st of March and the time is different it will be at 12:15 we will and also and hopefully we will have again a review session before that it is it on the schedule and that's review session we'll review previous final and you will enough time you have enough time to to sell some good problems so by the way not everything that you see insulation is valid for the real world Ender let's see how many skills we have here skip that's all I would have father ok ok does it does a skillet see the skin I will see some of you on Monday ok
