this presentation is delivered by the Stanford centre for professional development let's get started so today's video Sigma is it's about parallel parking I know a lot of she don't know how to do the parallel parking so now you get into the car you press the button and the car will pockets automatic parallel parking and returning to traffic Maneuvers India 10 we have developed and tested automatic parallel parking and pulling up numbers on an experimental electric car it's all can be triggered manually autonomously with automatic steering and velocity control it is very including to monitor it's surroundings when he wishes to park the car the driver starts the automatic parking mode and leave the vehicle the planning and decisional architecture allows the sequence of autonomous motions to be controlled in real-time in classic traffic situations within a parking area carboot alternately in the lane it's real-time motion sequence control ensures safe operation in a dynamic environment the car of weight Solutions with other cars in obstacles it continues the motion when the lane is free when it detects a free parking space that can't stop to the starting position in front of the space the system computer appropriate steering and velocity controls for a nominal trajectory leading to the publication a backward parallel parking manoeuvre into the space is then performed once the motion is carried out your system decide whether as suitable publication has been attained if necessary additional iternity of motions are performed within the parking space when the lateral displacement of the car is the fish the car adjust its location to Midway between the front and rear vehicles to ensure proper distance automatic pulling out required steering and velocity controls are planned and executed the car booster and appropriate sport at the rear of the parking space control commands are planned for the subsequent motion car turns and moves forward to leave the parking space it stops in the traffic lane and is then ready for further manual driving future work aims at integrating the automatic Maneuvers we have developed a novel urban transport system based on a fleet of June mode electric cars a preliminary manual mode version of this system with 50 electric cars this currently under evaluation via Paris future version will include all the automatic Maneuvers we are currently developing ok so a little progress was made the in the in the last year's in navigation of the car so now you just get to your place where you want to go and the drop the car and the girl will go along part itself and when you are ready to leave with your cell phone you just called the car and the car will come and pick you up what do you think about that quarter well we'll see Davis to announcement of the first one is regarding the mid-term wishes on Wednesday as you know next Wednesday it will be in class and preparing for the Mitcham we're going to have to review sessions you have them on your schedule Monday and Tuesday so it the same review session we will go over the meat Apache and it's very very important for you to attend now our group is very large and that's why we are going to sleep into two groups so that is a sheet of paper or you sign your name and wish they would like to Monday or Tuesday end I think it will be done just at the time when you are very hungry so don't worry about it we will have pizza for you and also we will have will have Sunday most stations of some robots in the law so the review sessions will be upstairs in the robotics lab in the open area and you just thought you just thought should be there at 7 we will we'll start with the demos and the pizza and then we will most of the River ok now probably some of you I was wondering about what is included in the mid-term and what is included in the meeting is all the letters after today that is we are going to cover everything up to the jacobian that will complete up fully today now over here you have for the stand for China normally sort the stand for salmon arm in picture many times and this is actually the one of the early Arms that was built in the early 70s so you can see here the first joined the revolu join about Mr access then there is another joint which is here and that I was to rotate up and down and I'm not going to be able to activate it because it needs to be connected to the controller so we released the bay there is a break right now that is working it in the horizontal position and I imagine you understand why otherwise it will sleep because we have the third giant which is which is prismatic so the Basmati joined is really an interesting feature about this on because you can now take this and effective and reach once you decide the direction you can quickly reach in that direction and advanced song well this has a limitation that is you can move up to here you have another stuff about I mentioned about the room and the race is here and it has 3 degrees of 3 so if we look at this race you can rotate it about this axis receive this motion this is joint for and John 5 joint 6 wishes massage stop something very interesting happens when joint 5 goes to 0 and this is what thank you very and it's really difficult to see exactly what that singularity is so I'm going to try to illustrate it the idea is when you go to joint 5 equal 0 this is the 0 of 5 what happens is this axis of rotation number four and axis of rotation number six decision one like this and one lives DS2 access become Colin Wright so for this position and orientation when these two access are calling your you are losing locally a degree of freedom and this degree of freedom that you are losing is the rotation about I don't know if you can tell me wish I'm going to pick cancel and try to find which we cannot rotate now so here here here we can repeat about this life we can still repeat about this what about this one your you're and if you was little bit out you will be able to repeat but you'll see there is a large rotation of 25 when we are at singularity what happens also is the fact that you have a Freedom here internal at the singularity for all these configurations combination of joint 4 and 6 you still have the single girl because joined 5 now is a to z so you can't not rotate about this Axis ok you're safe well you will have a chance at the end of the class to come closer and check it out litsa go to will there the definition of the kinematic singularity is here local leader and effective loses that ability to rotate or to translate about a given axis a given Direction ent Direction is called the singular Direction and for that location we have a singularity so the study of the singularity really depends on on those z-axis we saw here Z4 and z6 line and you remember in the in the jacuzzi and the z-axis office in The Commons so what really happens is that the jacobian if we look at the jacobian will its columns the rank of the jacobian is going to be reduced at the singularity that is there all a number of those colours that become Defender and you have a singularity so how do you study the rank of so you know that the mattress is singular you cannot invert it what do we use the determinant if the statute is Square you take the determinant and when the determinant is equal to Sarah you have you have no values for the single at the way we do it with we go and say let's compute the determinant as a function of the joint angles and what we will obtain is a set of expressions multiplying each other and those will be the determinant and does expressions are functions of cu so when we are looking for the singularity orbit we need to do is to take initial dose expressions and set it to 0 and that will give us the singularity associated with that particular expression so one thing to notice is as we look at the jacobian the jacobian expressions or more complicated in some friends than others so it is really important to revise your jacobian in a frame that is that gives you the simplest form and knowing that the jacobian Express inframe J I would give you a determined that isn't a course of the jacobian in free my we can do this transformation and not worry about the rotation matter so the determiner of the jacobian is independent of the frame do you know why anyone can tell me why yes is there a fire in Dubai go from jacobian in frame j2a jacobian in frame I already need is to promote apply by rotation metre like this so if you or in the 6 by 6 special case linear velocity and angular velocity digital print in frame can be transformed into a jacobian in friend by Primo applying the jacobian a matrix that has 2 got the same location matter that transforms the descriptions from A to B and that's why I give you the Netflix India now if you're digging determinant of these the determinant of jacobian indeed is equal to the product of the determinant of the two matrices and see these mattresses are often normal there determinant is 1 and that means we have the stroller ok I can go so so remember this and remember that you can use it to simplify expressions and immediately analyse your determine now once we said we are going to set this the determinant of the jacobian 20 we immediately see the singer or configurations because in the expression of the determined as I said the determinant will come up in this phone so it is product of expression S1 S2 S3 etc and each of the expressions when it's Vanishes it make the determinant equal to zero so if you have multiple singularities they are here anduze set expression to 0 and you get your singular Let's Stay the simplest example possible which has a 2 degree of freedom and see if we have a singularity for this jacou associated with the smack Lucy at singularity which is where when FIFA 2020 or 2pi or KP you align little points and you're going to have a single let's see it in the Nativity so I'm going to take X and Y x L1 cosine 31 + L2 9743 remember all over I know if we differentiate we have the cheque so as I said if we determine our expression for the determinant it comes to be L1 L2 sign of 2 and this Vanishes when the sign of 2 is equal to 0 which correspond to all the configuration when Q2 is equal Integra x Park so as I said also so you see the jacobian here You See It expression well it will become much simpler if we write it in frame 1 the ticket to from one we premultiply this jacobian by the rotation matrix 0 to 1 we are doing the multiplicative the rotation in the plane so it is a two by two don't be confused so we're just doing it in the plane all singularity this is the singularity when when we move the lost link to be aligned with the first one well in that configuration when the sign Vanishes this is the Jacobi yes O2 set timer 2 so here we say cosine theta 1 + 32 and 20 c12 or S12 would be the sign for the sun just to simplify to have a mortgage preposition song so this is this is what is happy so what do you see him you see directly that how these two columns are dependent and director of The Matrix is equal to so if we think about the displacement Belter Al's and daughter why associated with this configuration so if we make a small displacement delta theta 1 delta theta what would be the display sonoff accent aw well we know Dr axe is equal to jacobian so you're x and this is what you were playing that x it's going to be sure the row is there and the second row and multiplying what's the second rule of the heater one with the first element and doctor to the second element you see this young standards what does it mean for my daughter 70.3 tattoo Dr axe is going to be cold for sale and the reason for that is the fact that when we are in this configuration and when we make a small displacement delta theta one so we rotate about this act this point we know on the tangent of the circle right if you're a date about this access with Adelphi Theatre to unit 8 about you go on this pension that is we whether we move data one or two both of them are contributing to the displacement word a small displacement along this tension so there is no displacement that will take place around this Direct and that's why the X is equal to 0 Lucida yes call BMW how do you get the chicken here the last time Premiership a family from X and Y little going to be just the linear jacobian JV so we differentiate dr.axe the first column will be what what's the weather for respectable fine to data one so it will be miners ok you understand this everyone ok so when we rotated with this metrics multiplying at agonistico being add 0 and we are here and we're saying that beta 1 displacement fighter world be always in this Direction that is will be orthogonal to this Direction so that is new displacement outside and I'm looking here in frame 1 um1 so this is why and this is this is why and this is xx ok so let me show you this on a bigger robot what is the name of this robot very good so right now the promo is floating so if I apply for Stuart is going to rotate it's flooding I'm pulling like this I'm feeling like this if we all here what is this configuration if you tried to move the forma invoice Direction you apply for snuff movie Triton in this Direction knows because there is a small angle if this angle trading your data force and there is no motion and this is the singularity when you extend the on you cannot move along this Direction so if you apply any Force in the direction in editor you have emotion if your play whatever force you apply here there is no displacement along as Direct ok I understand the singer writing good so close this window no you're not the singularity that configuration that we are calling Singleton figures really the problem is not the singer let itself it is the region around the singularity because when you come close to that thank you dirty you start to have a metric that is a condition and if you try to make a displacement along research answer your you are in this configuration and if you're you are very close to it you can move but it's very heavy it's going to take a lot Force to bullet in make discuss at the elbow so what I'm going to do I'm going to take a small displacement out IQ yes the last slide white digital gift what time is it L2 why is the top right L2 S2 instead of l2s can anyone answer this question the timeline 7.0 is expressed in frame 1 stop step one is free what are the multiplication bye 0 21 actually this Matrix this matrix is x this give you in French 020 this one here I think you're confused because of this this is inform 0 and this matrix in frame 1 it is a program running that's why everything becomes slow so this is influenza ok to sell in French 0 because this is the rotation from 1 to 0 and this is the jacobian in frame 1 and when you make sign two equal 2000 L2 and L1 + L2 ok alright so let's go to the next flight tell rather than Computing the jacobian exactly I'm going to make a small African nation of the jacobian and I'm going to computer delta q that's good response by Delta x where we are in the that's singular of configuration so if 30 is equal to 0 I mean very close to zero Pikachu is Epsilon you can write this inverse of the jacobian you so what do you do if they tattoo is very small to approximate your sines and cosines sign updated who went through that was very small is it almost equal to does error and the cosine so if you do that and compute the inverse in from one this is the mattress you will open and from this mattress you can find the displacement to make a small displacement loparex you can compute the displacement required for delta q so that means if we want to make a displacement Dr axe one small displacement OX1 and small displacement of power y1 this would be the expression for no back showing and this would be the expression for Delta Taxis this is what exactly this is an approximation where we are working around the configuration data to equal to 0 but it is very useful to look at because as332 get smaller and smaller what are dividing by 0 you can see that so to achieve any Dr axe you are going to have a large displacement will text you phone defect you see that Willard added graphically so here is the configuration very close erratically if we look at displacement of fatal to that comes closer and closer to sete the displacement of 31 increases and the same thing if we come from the other side of 0 so we have this discontinued that makes it that we have large value of dog that you one that will be needed or large values of dog that you to that will be needed and when you get to the singularity that is no amount of value infinite Valley ok so this means that we have really 2D with the singular seen not only at 0 but also around the region where the thing about it sticking now in your homework in our discussions we always place the problem in special case but often the robots you are reading with become airplane and you have this Lord Matrix and you are going to study the jacobian of a mate that is actually no Square this is the case for if we take X Y and we take DJ Omega 001001 we end up with a large description with all these roads are so we talk about the reduced matrix that you can analyse indigo case responding to a linear motion for 80 degrees of freedom or airplane mode so if you have the gaze of two degrees of freedom your analysis is done on this Matrix on the two by two on the JV pot and you don't have a zip or so it is just a two by two ok in the case if you have so this is what you will be finding and becoming from this 2 by 2 m if you have a free degrees of freedom if you have a 3 degrees of freedom then you are going to have a mattress like this XY and disease and then you have the J Omega 001 so the reduce matrix will be in the plane would be XY and the last row basically you are dropping balls free Rose so this is your m and you study this determined and you will be able to find the singularity associated with this three degree of freedom manipulate so yes applying a robot that is that has 3 degrees of freedom the mattress that you going to analyse is going to be XY and the rotation about the Z axis so you can do it actually with this matter read to analyse the analyse the determinant of this matrix you don't know how to do it how do you take the determinant of this match so to analyze the singular configuration you can do it from here by forming Jason sports day and reducing the mattress for a 3 by 3 which correspond directly to eliminating the free Rose so the Matrix undertale captures the characteristics of rank of this man yes St Germain if the mattress is not square you have to go to a singular value decomposition and the singular value you basically look at the singular value by phoning the score of the match so the Medics that before movie The Squirrel that that's because we have 0 rolls we can just reduce three so we know exactly that we have x y and the rotation this is just a simple trick to help you do the analysis without going to send it via the computer right so here is the Stamford Shannon on and we just analyse I mean we just for the singularity of the shaman on by looking at joint 5 when it goes to zero and in fact if we do this competition we multiply the mattresses we do the different station you remember we did this last time and we are playing this matter so let's let's see what happens when Peter five goes to zero in this matter so could you tell me what is happening interested in is to see if there is immediately dependency between call whether when a configuration counts becomes dependent the visit film 1234 5 Angeles co16 foreign and 6 becomes ok let me write them for you that's what happened so the columns for and the column 6 are identical and which means that now you love the range the rank of this Matrix so we have a single out so basically the jacobian captures the that you see in the physical robot decide that win these two columns these two access all aligned essentially what is happening is you are getting to Carlow in the jacuzzi and that become independent ok everyone say that good now we're going to answer some concerns about this last friend you remember many times I repeat it and said well the rainbow and a factor the operating here or if I have a toll I'm concerned with this point here at the end of the tour in the middle of the 12 depending on the task so what you doing to do with going to use the intersection of the three axis as the point origin of all the frame and we developed a jacobian for and then we saw disco figuration at this phone now I said will be very easy to go from here to hear this information computing at this house is when we go from here to hear that is a constant Factor so FC is equal to xw Plus director so now going to see how it it from the description of the jacobian from associated with this associated with that yes set up a microphone killer I can see a thing so so essentially we have you have to friends 1 same associated with the friendly selected for the lock link in this case of this frame or the response and the second frame is this additional frame we are attaching to the interpreter so no think about it you have a vector connecting the origins this is the Victor any connecting the law frame to this location of ENT effect now the velocities linear velocities and angular velocities at that point are Transformed two linear velocities and angular velocities at the input and the question is what is the difference between the two so internal if we go back to the robot and if we think about we have some velocity velocity here mopping this point this are the same time is rotating widowmaker so the question is what is the Omega hair and what is the v here but someone tell me what will be the linear velocity of this given the linear velocities that we know of this and angular velocity giving we know Vienne and Omega and what is Vee and Omega Omega is equal to omega everyone agrees that's correct and V is equal to VN who disagrees with how many ages so some of you still think it is the symbol of v = 2 v n your numbers apple then is an additional velocity coming from the fact that this there is an angular velocity here that is going to attack the single of Wallis even if there was zero velocity at this point ve amine VN the movie song linear velocity due to the rotation so the relationship between the two is like the vy is equal to the N plus Omega in Crosby and and other relation is is fine this is correct so I wonder why I switch and put Minors anyone know the same thing if you cross something that's why after this phone so basically by Omega and is now linear in V and Omega we put it in the other side and the reason is I would like to connect the two and do you see how can we connect the two what is the relationship between the factor VN Omega n as a vector and vy and Omega Azul what is the is some Netflix and this matter involves what because this is identical and and be my cross what is png cross how do we make the antichrist isometric exactly so we use the cross product operate so actually this writing allow us to find this Matrix immediately connect vien Omega and TV omega what is on the diagonal vvn miners b&e so it is the first black bag and what is identity the 2nd Omega he is going to be identity x Omega and so there will be zero identity and what is the longest opera block on direct is Morris the cross product apparatus so basically we have the identity of the day again we have zero and we have - be my hat ok so now we have a linear relation between the two and it involves just the Spectre connecting the wrist to that point and we are taking the cross product operator of that back now when we do this competition you have to be very careful to make sure that you're not your P&P vector is described in frame and most of the time it's just like a straight line along the Z axis it is just a small length long that's the axe so it will be 007 if you're vianne Omega and is described in French 0 you cannot do this multiplication so you need your operator to be described in French so we have the attention to this and to make sure that this conversation is carried correctly so that we seen as being in the same thing is it Kobe in frame and is now related to the jacobian physically and identify factors related to the jacobian and by this Matrix and we have to make sure that the jacobian here is expressed in the same frame to produce the same frame jacobian advent effect yes Google bring the last joined to the end effector which character in both JV and J Omega there is a route now the question is I'm backing this is general expression of the relationship when we have a jacobian in French 0 we have to make sure that this operator is influenza is there in the last train train what is the total is it Omega VN and Omega in are the are the linear velocities and angular velocities produced by over join expressed at the end effector frame not any of them at the last link same same and we are now Computing the velocities at the next frame the end of act and that's why we can substitute V and Omega in with j and Q that in and this would be vaporeon cute and this is true for any Q so this is the relations so what you see you is that did you call me another restpoint in this case is transferred to the jacobian at the end effector recently by taking the cross product associated with the orange venison so this is the relationship if we we are in friends are I said this operator should be in French 0 now you're going to make the mistakes I'm going to tell you not to do it explain why and then you have the relation correctly for this operator in French suppose you have your operator in Fleming how do you transform into friends so I think the doctors 007 in frame in and I take it that operator and then want to transform my two friends are also you so what day do you pray X or the operator and 3 x the rotation matrix to frame 0 how many degrees weather no one you're alone so how you different then you not agree with him so how do you do off the alarm but no one is really good convinced yet so have to find so how how we do that the problem is his statement is wrong you cannot just take an operator and transform it this way buy just a rotation matter this is a similarity transform you have to re multiply and possible to play and the reason is think about it from the beginning let's go back to this blue equation and think about it so we are saying that let's go back to the vector representation so what do you have transforming is the Victor in frame and X the better Omega in French and just running down this is this this is Victor relation so now what we are going to do we are going to take this factor and now I'm going to express metrics in the frame and that leads to this relation the transformation is so if you if you did your operation in French you transform it using the similarity transform you are because you are not applying you're assuming you are not replying by the Omega in the appropriate frame which is frame in so you have to go what's x and 0 now the best way to do it perhaps is just to go to pee the increment transformer to friend 0 and then just do the operation I mean the cross product operation in French and then you will have a direct secure start with p transformer two friends and then you can get directed up otherwise if you have a operator in friend you need to do this ok don't do that mistake alright so here are the two important relations we learn the first one is a jacobian in Fermoy is transformed as a coven in frame and the relationship involves only be multiplication by a rotation matter indicate jacobian in frame in that we would like to in French we have duvet diagonal transformation from frame in 20 that for the operator you have to put the similarity transfer ok well there is here and example off jacobian computed at this point as a cobian computed as the end ActiFry and we are computing this vector w from E20 I'm going to skip it because we really don't have time to do it but once you you I think you have it in your hand out just go through and you'll see that you can compute Jay-Z from this day omega simply by computing this operation associated with the vector connecting w and what we did is we computed be in French 0 and found the operator in frame 0 Direct so please take a look at this end so I'm going to remove because we we are going out to discuss something important about the Jacobean and this is the fact we already started to introduce a little but the final visit again is very useful not only to analyse velocities but also two to control the room most industrial but actually are controlled just what did you cook because this jacobian is always connecting your desired position and orientation of the end effector you have some delta x here and if you know how to control the joint motion all what you need is to say ok this configuration I would like to make a small displacement overhang what would be the smallest displacement olfaction and that can be obtained from the UK because the jacobian is giving you this relation and if you are outside of the singularities what can you do can you come to Dr Peter that corresponds to your daughter xx this is this is the relation can be used directly to compute displacement daughter to follow what you would like to achieve with no tax and you start from theatre you know the theatre you know your axe you can computed from the forward kinematics you want to go to exercise then you can compute a lot facts by taking accident minus x hopefully this is more so you can use the jacobian and then you can compute the corresponding DOTA 2 this doctor using this relation left and then you not do that so you control the robot to move from Peter to title Plus ok you see this coronavirus you matter where you are you know your data you know it you know your ass and you went to make a small displacement over X or what you need to do is two computers delta heater from you so basically you have a soft controller is using using the jacobian to compute this area between your desired position and measure position computed from the 4 kinematics as a function of your cues and that will give you a daughter to you that was distributed to each of the Jar and ask the joints the track ok so this is the resolve motion rate control proposed by than Whitney back in the 70s this simple algorithm if you don't really care about Dynamics if you don't care about first control contact of the robot with the environment this is fine that will and if you're outside of singularities this will take you through how do you say it's not going to work very well because you're going to have problems with accelerations if your tracking emotion you are basically doing this and you will have a lot of errors and that's still if you have just small and slow motions this is going to work the last point in our discussion deals with static Force and again there's a coven is going to give us the answer that's why now with this Jacob we saw that we are able to understand the velocities produced at the end of act of giving the joint policy but we are going also to see that physical is part of this relationship between forces exerted by the end effector and talks produced at the joints the same Matrix stop how can you stop ok let's go now we're in the robotics lab James was the TA I took that photo when he was able to couple of years so how do you open this door come on so you take your hand and you start after turning the knob you push little and it's going to rotate you see how it's going to work till it's analysing so you're pushing here right at some location and you have the axis of rotation right stop there would be a linear velocity the bushing with the some velocity so at that point there is some linear velocity corresponding velocity that is some angular velocity about the x you see that now we can also think about the forces on pushing with so the linear velocity is related to angular velocity by this relation results the forces if I apply a force here they will be at or actually I could have this door actuated with a motor producing a torch that corresponds to a force here and there is complete relationship between the two and do you know what is the relationship between the two torque and Force the Godfather but in this in this way the Borg is equal to P cross f so the talk now is on the other side and the F is on this side ok so v&f your CV and if they are crossing little Stoke actually the first equation of April sort of a jacobian relating velocity vs omega Orthodox and the second relation is representing sort of transpose of vegetable and we going to so let's go and Annalise so we have omega we have Lia velocity n this is the relation here we can write it in this phone we can say we is related to Omega by minor the hut right dog if we want to produce a first day you can apply a torque and that would be equal to B cross f which can be now represented by P hartup lipstick that and put it really similar to this so it's minus perhaps it is identical that you see this transpose I'm writing because the operator is asymmetric you get Minors the operator equal that transports I'm just reading it - be happy so basically this is the jacobian and this is the transpose of the Jacobi ent if we went to really to check it out just put a frame and compute this operator it will be minus by PX this are the coordinates of this vector bxby and if you put it there it is this so basically there is a duality between this is for one degree of freedom adore is 1 degree free so there is ideology between velocities and Horses we can compute the total responding to the forces acting at the point by looking at this metrics - by PX or if we can compute the velocity this is a jacobian and this is is it good being transpose and the relationship between forces involves the same match in Trance ok so remember these two relations they are from the 90s relations in the kidney robots but they are going to play a very important role as we go to Dynamics and control velocity enforce ok well there are many different ways of it actually is establishing this relation tell you remember when we wanted to establish the relationship between velocities at the joint and velocities at the end effector we said we can do propagation velocity and computers propagation from inside the base through benefactor and find the relationship and expect digital well you can do the same here you can say my Robot is in contact with the environment and it is applying to the environment a force if and a torque or moment in and you can start from the end and go down and propagate velocity have been propagated Force and find the relationship between forces at the end of act and thoughts of Flight of the job and this propagation is going to leave to the jacobian transpose after elimination of all the internal forces because when you are pushing with the robot the structure of the robot is taking part of the force and the other part is going to the joint and the joint are going to supported with motor tax so if we do the seven nation we have to be careful that we prefer at Easter forces on the axis of the choice to make sure that we are looking at the active part of the first so we're going to just briefly look at this and then I will show you another way of doing the analysis using the Rushworth pencil how do we do this so if you have a problem with the application of forces and you are reaching a static Equilibrium and you are saying I'm going to try to establish the relationship between those forces Andrew Stone it is at that occur because you're applying this and these are brushing being violent and being violent is pushing word equal and opposing forces and moment how do I do it we just break it down we break it down into pieces and we did each of the rigid bodies and we say it's of the rigid body is going to have to be ecstatically so we start from the top and we say first of all this is the forces of Fighters environment which means the last link is receiving the reaction forces of the van minus f and minus 10 and it's on the other side of the link at the giant it's receiving some photos S3 and entry on link and you do the same for the other one ok then what do you say well if he should this is at static equilibrium how do you express that what are the condition the force is equal to 0 and some of the moment computed at with respect to any point on the rigid body or equal to that and you have Saturday Club so this is the last thing and now if we take one of them and Express what you just said so static equilibrium when some of the forces equal to zero and some of the moment with respect to any point because then then you can find a relationship and this relationship are going to be in this phone forces + equal to 0 this one plus the moment associated with the force if I + 1 is equal to 0 if I'm computing at that point and that is the origin of fame and from this you have a Christopher relations so you can thank you backpropagation fi as a function of I pass one in I as a function of these you back propagate and your extract the jacobian before that what you need to do is to project on the access and make sure though you are a getting the forces as you're propagates the giant you are if the joint is prismatic you are going to project the force because if I'm doing something here this way the only thing that will come is a force level make it translate so that would be a 4 for a joint with roller joined the forces of supported by something what county is the Momo so you prefer in there the moment and the total service is protected by dark product with the Z I access and you get this algorithm and now you're perfect from the 40 playing back to the ground and from there you can find your jacobian transpose well again you in this case the jacobian is invalid inside your numerical calculation that is you are propagating from the end to find your jacobian so did you go can be computed by velocity propagation you can compute the jacobian transpose by backpropagation of forces or we saw and this is the simplest way is to compute explicitly the jacobian by looking at the structure and what you obtained the recovery that way the explicit jacobian you can infect immediately go and state what is the jacobian associated with the force we can reduce the amount of this country in a different way this analysis was relying on taking the mechanism and breaking it into pieces and eliminating the internal forces to find a Jacobi we know something about the mechanism and about the forces about active forces about internal forces that would allow us to make a statement more general statement that walk not require us to go and do this photo luminous and this is the virtual work principle are you familiar who is familiar with the virtual works from 12345 it's very simple and it's very important in fact in dynamic plate tidying if you take a mechanism you can just drop all the internal forces and just worry about activ4 because internal forces are worth they are not going to move anything they are supported by the structure so I'm going to avoid them and I'm going to make an emotional statement about static equilibrium which is so we're going to think about the the work you know what what is first dance displacement right so we can think about the work done in small and is there always placement there are forces acting along those this place and what are you going to say is that a static equilibrium so this is the statement can you read it what does it mean that is if we take all this active forces that are acting along the axis of displacement so all external forces are active if you push on the robot is going to move if you apply a talk at the joint of datum of internal forces are not going to produce any they are taking by the structure so now we need to deal with two things the forces indoor adventure f&n vs flight baby in van and he talks and what I'm going to say I'm going to ride this relation I'm going to say the virtual world done by all these forces has to be equal to 0 if I'm in static equilibrium otherwise there will be a Martian so what is the work done by the torque well the work done by the courts talk transport data queue the dot product between delta q and the talk and what is the the work done by external forces the dot product between between Earth and what is the weather name Delta because f is acting along x Direction X Y and Z ok that so the whole thing now is captured by the secret resume that if we are really aesthetically on these talks are supporting the forces ok just extract the relationship from how do you do it well you have daughter x you have got back to you do you know any relationship between price and thank you the Courier very good so nice used physical being and that gives you this relation for any dogs that which by transpose gives you your answer right so basically this whole thing comes to be very simple if you just look at principle that I've checked the power and you can go and look at internal forces then your computer then you eliminate them and then you find the relationship between the active Force and external forces app or you just did it stop we have this duality and you have here an example showing you how you can compute the Toast to support one Newton innocent you'll you take the jacobian transpose and do the multiplication and the answer is going well we computed for L1 equal 1 equals 1 equals 0 and 32 equals 60 and you need this amount of talk to support that 1 Newton Force now if I'm going to play £1 1000 news so let's see will you do the same thing we put the 1k of four forces along the Z axis I'm in the y-axis in this case here longest Direction and I'm going to computed at this configuration L1 L2 R1 = 90 degrees c 2 is equal to 0 do you not do can you imagine this configuration this is this country Curtis oh you cannot see it it is the configuration when the whole arm because vertical why didn't anyway 1.1 and join to other line and the answer is 0 what happened you're putting down here and you're pushing down you can take any Force because of the singer I think of everything we cannot move but we can sustain a lot of I produce a lot of forces with a small amount of when you come to think about it to produce a large first just make small talk and you have used amount forces and when you are the singularity you can sustain and that's why when you are lifting something have you got Like This is love just like this way use your single I feel that so the homework is due now on Friday I hope everyone gets the message and the homework that is distributed today will be do and the week after the meeting I will see you on Monday
