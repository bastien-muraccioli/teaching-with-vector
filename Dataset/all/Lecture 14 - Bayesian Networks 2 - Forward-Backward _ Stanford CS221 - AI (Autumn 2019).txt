right ok started continue talking just a quick recap we can talk about patient networks which is a new paradigm for defining models what is a bayesian network are you have a set of variables which are nodes in a graph for example whether you have a cold with you have allergies when you're coughing with you these notes are related by herself record ages which capture various dependencies for itchy eyes is caused by allergies but not hold or by car and then formerly for every variable in Division at work you have a local conditional distribution which specifies the distribution over there variable given the parent show the parents of cough or cold analogy you would have a local conditional distribution of p of age given CNA do that for all the variables if I know when you take all the factors or a local conditional distribution remote fly them together can you come 1 glorious joint distribution over all the possible variables in Europe so another the summer that you can think of vision networks static crab plus probably define joint distributions of lots of random variables are using tachographs which allow you discuss very compact moreover we sort of how we can use the structure of Factor graphs to permit efficient inference in bayesian networks is the task of innovation network which is this Oracle about what you know about the world on and you look at some evidence that you feel it's raining or not or oh you have itchy eyes arceaux and are you condition on that evidence and you also have a set of where you variables are you interested asking about and the goal is to compute the probability of a Gregory most condition on the Avalon the Eagles live remember this is a very much lower case is actual value so for example in the coughing case there is on the probability of a call are given the fact that you're coughing I don't have itchy eyes and this this probability is defined by Justin was a probability which we went over the first slide of La structure and the challenges how to do this and that's going to be the topic of any questions about the basic setup of w a g h r and on how do you what it means to follow 1-minute kind of high-level know about days and hours is that I think there really powerful as a way to describe and knowledge I think a lot of focus on particular tasks where you find some input output in your trainer classifier and the classifier that you thinking only do this one thing input-output the paradigm behind is not working databases in general is that you have the Velvet I'm in knowledge source which can be probabilistic gets captured by the story I want to have it use of Toyota probably to allow you answer arbitrary question so you can give me any pieces of evidence and any query and it's clear what I meant to do and what I can compute these so this is kind of a more flexible and Powerful of Paradigm then just burning employees that's why I think it's so in ok so today we're going to focus on how to computers arbitrary inference queries efficiently I'm going to start with for back or in particle filter in these are going to specialise to the specific of bayesian networks Holiday Gems hidden Markov models and then we can look at it sampling which is done much ok so a hidden Markov model which I thought about last time and which were going to go in more detail at this time is a network where there is the a sequence of in a corresponding sequence of observed variables so as I can avoid feeling sample imagine your tracking some sort of object in your homework by tracking cars ihi is going to be the location of the object or car at a particular time step I NCIS going to be some sort of sensor reading that you get at that particular time could be the location plus annoys or some sort of distance to that on the trot I'm in Assam these are the variables and no it goes well saying that the hidden variables are hidden and observed variables an the distributions over this all the variables are specified by 3 of local conditional this the first one is just a starting distribution what is a probability of 8 I'm this could be a uniform over all possible locations just as an example arm and then we have the transition distributions which that safe I what is the distribution of a particular hidden variable the location of the true location of object HIV given 18 - 1 no just captured Dynamics of how the object might move over time for example I could just be a uniform over adjacent location scan telephone they can only move to a different location finally we have emission distributions which Govern how the sensor reading is are computed as a function of the location an so this again could be something as simple as uniform or adjacent locations if you expect to see some noise it doesn't tell you what exactly the car I told you a price and the joint distribution overall these random variables is going to be given by Simply the product of everything I'm just going to write ASAP on a budget for we have the probability of stage show this when I write he goes oh that means of the h13 all the reindeers hidden round they're both observed random variable and this is by definition equal to the start distribution Direction here saws dark distribution over on each one and then I have the transitions I was um1 I guess due to an so this is the probability of hiv-1 and finally I have four every time step I through 1 and the probability of observation given on HR multiply these factors together that gives me a single number that is the probability of order observed in order any questions about the definition of a hidden ok given we have one of these models remember with a vision at work I can answer any sort of curries I can ask what is the probability of it's 3 and 82 and 85 I can do it also all these things are possible inefficient computer we're going to focus on two main types of Flash I'm motivated by the the first question is filtering children says you're in a particular time step what's a time step 3 what what do I know about the true object location is three given all the evidence I've seen up real-time object tracking in time you look at all the evidence and you want to know where the object a similar question is moving and you're so looking at a particular time stop um3 letters I'm by your conditioning on all the Everton do you look at all the observations and you're looking at you can think about this more retrospec where was object where was object I think about if you're trying to reconstruct the project so this is called filtering and smoothing I'm so what's now try to develop an algorithm for answering these type of query and I'm without loss of generality I'm going to focus on answering smoothing why is it the case that if I how are you I can solve all smooth are questions I can also solve all film ISO this song in filtering this is a the evidence is a subset but the answer is there going to be different depending on what you can mirror use one lies over the things that you 45 yeah that's that's the key idea is that supposed I had a smooth and I wanted to answer this filtering so this is H3 giving you want me to remember last time we talked about how you can take leaves efficient networks which are not empty essentially welcoming so if you don't have my 45840 you can just pretend those and now you're back to a smoothing query where condition so we're going to focus on smoother how to make a progress on this problem I'm going to introduce a represent that's going to help us think about the possible Justin Bieber declare right there the reason why this is not completely trivia is that there are if you have any I'm hidden variables works number of possible dentists in Limerick have to come up with some should have more it's on what we're going to do is introduce the slightest representation which is going to go Versailles compact way of representing those on and then we can see how we can operate on that record going to snow a lot like Stevie small so we can go in backwards about good idea behind a large presentation is that I'm going to have I said off Rose and Co which column is going to correspond to a particular or variable so the first column is going to correspond to each one Heathrow is going to corresponds to sun setting of a that variable so there's two possible things I can do I can either I said each one you was one or I can set it to 1 this version on the boiler is going to be a simplification of what I have just sad space I'm in a second column is going to be either I'm it shoe what's 1 rage 2 by going through these or ladders I'm a sign in random variables to a particular Guy ESO I'm going to connect these off so from this stage I can either said it's 2 equals 1 or 20 can also go from to one or two and finally what's 1 x 3 = 2 and similarly I can choose either one of them and finally have it the first notice that the size of the ladders is reasonably well control it's simply the number of times that x number of values a variable can take on so let's suppose that there's and time stops k apostle what a location cell values so how many are here ok that means we can essentially this doesn't now let us intro a path from start what is a path from Southend to Harlow what time is it one of the 1 is this tell us yeah yeah it's a particular Simon of this one says sell it won't 102 the one it's three this past said it wanted to it's 11 in history every path from start and is an assignment all the unobserved or Hillingdon ok so now remember you just Simon cons with some sort of probably so we're going to try to represent us product I'm just oppose on this SLR go to each other please remember these are the probabilities every assignment as it's product of the factors and I'm going to basically take me factors and just sprinkle them on the edges I'm at the point where I can computer explain why an so so many 11 scan for eliminating I should Mansion is supposed to feel this example we are conditioning on a 1 equals 1 I'm eat you because I'm are 2 likes you when you're 23 unconditionally on this I'm not trying them in here because these are observed variables I don't have to reason about what are you I'm only going to consider it the hidden variable what is this just going to be snowing ok so let's start with start to each one he goes if you remember all that tracking and csp we basically took off factors and then whenever we couldn't buy with the factory put it down I'm bad here at what we can we do we have the probability of each one equals and then we also have the probability of the first mission probably I can compute right so that's a probability of 1 = 7 and I saw which is wine giving each one equals 1 about you this is a number that is exactly the way tour fast what score when everyone is that a incurred when I prefer that ok so what about this do I have the transition from Alexa Age 2 equals 1 given each one equals 1 x the probability of Y2 = 50 which is to giving it to you similar over here I have probably bh31 given H2 = 1 x a probability of 3 = one which is whatever and then over here there's no more factors laughter and you can check that when I traverse this path in a multiply all these together that's exactly this expression for each 1 = 1 x 2 = 1 x 3 = 1 E1 = 123 bus and for each other edges I have an analogous quantity depending on The Voice any questions about this basic idea this is basically ok so so now now what I'm trying to do now is to what say I'm interested in so I'm interested in what is the probability of Age 3 quotes what sauce do they sample is that one suppose I'm interested in property who is = to giving the evidence what's 2 - 3 this is the aquarium interested in your car how can I interpret this what is it in terms of this song so this is there is this song HGV bus to here that somehow privy ask what is the probability of thus giving them yeah just some overall the on probably never remember every pass through from Southend is an assignment some of those pads go through the snow which means that each week was too and some of them don't if you look at all the stars and you a sum of their weights of this now in / the some overall pads then you can the probability of HPV goes to giving so limited this is going to be some over colloquially some over pads through an age 20 + 2 / Dynamo over of the problem is to computer some overall pads going through it's too word again we don't want to some or all the past literally because that's but I'm so some of the weeds so what I mean bye I mean some of the every path has a weight which is the the ways on edges Andy Summers ok so what's an idea that we can use to computer the song yeah I don't know this arm we're going to do this country Chris let me just show the slide so it's going to be a little bit different from the timer for grabbing that we saw before it's going to be on ward general because we're not computer in that one particular query but I'm going to computer bunch of Wonder Deezer flowers so what's there's going to be free quantity going to my cat hopefully I can out of colour so there is going to be on your forward messages app which are explained there's going to be backward I'm ok so what I want to do is a for every night I'm going to computer to number I'm not what colour is that shut up so let's call this ass so for every night I'm going to compute to number what number of call the following number is or the 4 message is going to be the Somme overall the weight of the pressure pads going into download the Orange number is going to be the sum of all the partial parts from that note what's all on these are meant to be probability so the number should be less than 1 bookkeeping simple I'm going to put actual numbers on the just to just to integers and Africa wymott 12 wine wire to wire remember every Edge has a weight associated with it so now let me come to arm so what is the sum of all of us going SS1 Esso sorry 4 minutes wine and this is 2 just happiness nowra Crucible what is the sum of all the weights going into this Esso I could have come from here or I could have come from here if I come from here it's 1 time whatever the song was there so that 1 x 1 x 1 Plus 2 x 2 so I'm going to get a 5 oneplus here I'm going to have are 1 and 1 so that 11 x 2 that's 2 so that's one of you you guys are checking my mouth here so this could have going into your could have come from this know that now x 5 so that's 10 1 x 3 and that's 3 x 13 this is arwijn x 5 3 x 2 13 represents The Sum Of All pads going into so I can do the backward Direction so an so this is going to be in orange the backward messages which are eyes going to the answer this is going to be one yeah I'm going to have 2 times 1 1 x 1 that A3 and this is 1 x 1 2 x 1 arrears while this is one 1 x 3 2 x 6 9 ok that makes sense 0 tonne of compact representation sova no it's actually the flow in an ALDO ok so there Canada magic happens on when I have on these asses for every node and going to also just multiply them together so that's one of you are sick 18 18 913 11 what happens when I multiply them to go let's take a look at this what is 9 represent 9 represents the Sum Over all the pads going through because I can take whatever pass I have coming in and I can take one of has I have coming out any sort of combination of them will be valid and disorders taller waders why do we multiply instead of some here because Wormhole to find the weight of a path is the mathematically what's going on is exactly right so I suppose I had I'm numbers let's say A and B and C and I could choose AMV and C&D what are the possible so then I can do 8 + 3 x 3 + right which is the song over all possible are you can just how do you do a c Ed I'm basically doing this computer in a factorise way rather than x that's mathematically what's going multiply the following and where it is called Messi the idea of messages I come from the fact that you can't really think about the forum messages as being kind of sent across a g right because the message here depends only on the neighbour and what I got these messages my messages are next time stab FaceTime so it's a summary of what's going on send a message to foreign and same in the back ok so now once I have these values how do I go in back and complete my query camera repairs HGV Class 2 what is that over the sum of our parts what's a summary anything else up I was checking because when you some these two numbers you get 24 which is all some of our paths going through here and that better be the same number here and also ok these are all the pads going through 9 sorry I'm going through this now and if you look at all has that's going to be 15 + so final answer is the probability of each 2 equals 2 given these made up of is going to be 9 over 2 any questions about that so let me just quickly over the flight which is going to be a more mathematical treatment of what I did on the board one of those wall resonate with you define the 40 messages for every note is going to be a Sum Over all the values at the previous time steps of the four message at a previous times the weight on the edge from the previous value to the current are you the backward is going to be the find simile for every no sum of all the values assigned to them at the next time outgoing edges I'm off the back or message at the next time set awaiting stop and then to find us simply just the product of and finally if you normalise this song edit point in time you can get distributional further Edinburgh wool giving to summarise the algorithm the forward backward algorithm exactly very old an develop battery first for speech recognition 16 I'm c-suite forward you compute all the four messages and then you sweet backwards and computer all the background messages and then every position you computer si3 try and you don't know the Alfred of this algorithm is not just the answer to one query order smoothing query because and every position you have the distribution of the Hillingdon and the running time is n x k squared because there's and time steps and every time stab you have to computer some 4ak possible values are you look at Kim Possible Square an accent interestingly if you ask ok what's the cost of computing a single query Renault OBD and x that you can see all the queries in the same time so this is only work for tomorrow there's certainly adaptations of this which work very naturally for other types of networks one Amelia analysation Manchester chainsaw tree structure and idea of atom messages 10 it's probably fabrication is just arbitration at work this won't work because I want you have psycho then you can rap to summarise the sliders representation I Eliza to think of as assignments which is a familiar idea if you think about this model we can use dynamic programming to computer systems officially but we're doing this extra thing work completely all the sons of all the cruise at once and before backward algorithm allows you to share in a million play mirror of the Honda show the output of this algorithm is basically the probability of a child giving order for every hour take me to so how would you actually use this sample from depends on what you want to do the alpha reverse you can think about it a Distribution at each time and I came from that you can sample if you you might be interested in only ok let's move on to the second album which is called particle filter we're interested still in hidden Markov models on a particle filter something much more general than that I'm in working only focus on query filtering filtering single time step for only interested in the probability of the hidden girl about that time and why my not be satisfied with hidden Markov so here's the motivating picture imagine you doing the core assignment and you're so your tracking cars that say live on it grid each position a try the value of each type is some point I don't know where it is you want if this is like 100 by 100 no that's 10000 if it's worth in work continuous leaving worse so this is k squared work is the number of values could be 10000 Square right so even though hidden start with that 4 backward is not exponential using the quadratic and in the further of the motivation is your you intuition have to a damage because not see your sensor tells you that the car is off your somewhere new car cameras all the way across so then no the Amazon is going to consider each of these possibilities the motive hardest builders are going to have can we some help Focus our energies on the region avast reflux and the question is can you go aqua each of these variables and they don't have to be from the same this presentation they're in the same but I think what you're asking is you know that may be removed then there is some restriction on it's not going to be that significant because you still don't know where the car is so it doesn't Roy may be biased ok so how are we robot making bus album I'm what's look at me so I finally over them it's not going to give us inspiration so remember Indian search we keep a set of key candidates of partial assignment I'm in aramis follows you start with single and ESA NN4 every position timestamp I'm going to consider all the candidates which are assignments to the first one extended possible ways of extending setting hi2 AV from any V in I'm so now I'm going to Masters dad of I'm extended assignments now have k x as me because each of previous time ago prune down I'm just going to take all them sort them by weight and take the visually remember from last time it looks like this here is after tracking on Wi-Fi variable you start with a beam search which is on 9 x 120 or one and then I'm you extended so your send assignment different down there send assignment to Ferndown and at the end of the day you get k Canada to each candidate is for Simon toll variables in House of particular way intermediate time is a partial assignment to only the prefix of hi remember that being so she doesn't have any guarantees it's just a stick any picture picture you should have in your head is that you have the size 3 of all possible Simon being search what time does prune breakfast search on the tree which only WhatsApp promising directions quetzal on you can use them search you got a set of candidates which are for Simon to all the random variables on and you can computer equality so problem with this is that it's slow for the same reasons as I describe it requires considering every possible value on better than writer for Ford back you have other domain size times of dementia in alphabet an the size of the beam x but still I think we can do and finally there's a scandal more seller point is that as well see you later really taking the best k monopoly is just ok quick visual don't suppose you you've been consist of only cars over here it's kind of a load everyday but you my wife I can apply ok so that I deal with oracle filtering is to just week being such a little bit and this is gonna be expanded through stop switch on me is the one you just on the board and reset look at the video if you are number so there's three steps Here I'm going to try to do this pictorial that idea behind Park is I'm going to maintain a set of particles that they represent where I think they are arm you're the object teleporter course and I'm going to go through these 3 Steps propose wait Anam resample this is meant to be kind of or replacement of the extent Australia ok so the first that is to propose any point in time Park Hotel train maintains acid horse what time known as particles try to mimic a particular disk though second jump into the second time sad we can think about this setup particles is representing the probability of H1 and H2 given the evidence I'm on the board I'm only going to draw the and the particle representing the value think about are really partikelfilter maintains this song ok so the key idea of the proposed this is that ok we want of that time so with interest and H3 we will have it to also have so we propose possible values in HD based on h2so this is idea we just simply draw history from this transition this distribution is compliment you're divination and you can do this and this gives us I said a new particles which are now extended by one and this represents the distribution is 1033 the same actually you should think about propose as a proposes kind of taking you to these particles and sample according to the transition so think about the particles moving in Santa Thomas like simulating where no cars stochastically ok that too is to wait so far the new locations really don't represent RV because we also ce3 types of three we get a new Operation that hasn't been in Cork we're just millennium might happen pencil idea behind a real waiting is ridiculous particles Wigan assign awake now which is equal to the mission distribution over E3 given again this is a mission distribution which is given by you like it and the set of new particles which are wedded every thought of representing this distribution well now we have conditioner E3 YouTube particles has song and it's picture kind of looks like this so maybe what say the emission distribution is I know that's a on Gaussian distribution around suppose the observation tells you what it's over here some which means that these particles are going to a higher weight and these particles are going to get I'm anything for way enough there may be there like almost zero waste and I'm going to Barclay x visa so think about Jesus I'm ok meme operator South Downs nothing really gets at 0 think about these down waiting and these provided you have left us some evidence A3 that ok so the final stop is is really about a resource distribution so now we have weird particles we need to somehow get back to on weight racer which one is it imagine you have the situation where you have particles which account distributed the weight of the particles are fairly uniform then you could imagine let's take just the particles with a higher is this very similar what all the particles with Highway and I just keep those enough arm this is not a crazy thing to do but is a mite give you a impression that you're more coughing then because imagine that the weight are fairly uniform so maybe this one is .5 in this one is like .4 so you're coming breaking ties in a very biased way so the idea is that if you from the situation you can get something alarm off how do you sample from this distribution to the general idea is if you have it reviews for ma if I give you a distribution on over my possible values then I'm going to draw let seiki samples from if I add a distribution of a 4 possible locations with these probabilities or wait then I might drop off for samples and I might pick a 1 then a 2 in anime pick a 1 and some of these things are not going to be chosen if it helps going back to the oracle filtering setting we have his old cargos remembering which our wedding and first and Gordon normalize these Aldi's numbers of interfere and then I'm going to sample according to the station mission giver why am I dry in this case euro 111 cinema drive again my not even keep this Park and the idea here is that supposed to park has really really low then I shouldn't can over keep on it around news attractive it is basically right so this resampling regenerates the poor by focusing the efforts are on the highway even if I wake Park and then not sample the lower Park ok so in this I am this picture here recycling night alright so maybe now I have maybe a sample this twice maybe these don't get sample so the blue represents the particles after does one round of particle filtration where I've kind of moves articles over here lullaby and lots of weight that's why it's kind of cold particle tracking because you can think about the swarm of particles representing where the object might be overtime as I follow the transition Dynamics and I'm heading with observation I can move this one ok so let's go through and therefore my with them it's going to be very similar to being sorry install with my assignment and then you propose where you take your partial assignments to the previous I minus one variable and then I'm going to consider for each one of them just sampling ones transition distribution and Augmentin Dad online theme search where the size of c x k x larger than see the size of cprime is equal to s i really wait so looking at the evidence and applying the evidence problem evidence given the particle HR gives me a wait for every Oracle and then I'm going to normal distribution sample ceolmund independently from that the registry the the park to wear out ESO let's go through this song demo the same problem I'm going to say the number 400 so I sort with all the particles assign EX1 0 and 100 extend I noticed that some of the particles go 20-in somebody particles to go to one writing a probability proportional to y Zara we're going to redistribute changes the learn extend extend I prune I really me noticed at the powerhouse kind of get more this is more diverse than more deveson beam search because I'm using but you can see that I'm some of these particles by the like my like this one have 0 wait so that Iris Apatow when we ugly all the ones in the office yeah so that's a good question so noticed that all of these are all the 0 for the purposes of x4r so if you only care about the Martian then you can class in this demo is I'm meeting in tyre so this is that point if you only care about the last position inaudible the possible Project then you action actually collapse all the particles with the same TGI Intu 1 in a 40 more if there is replace then you can just when does exactly what you were doing I'm giving you a can of the more general more general than just looking at the last time most of the time so just a quick a quick on visual illustration of Earth what's the finest factory where you have transitions that are basically 100 depending on weather why - 1 plus 2 charger and Elias I'm sensory one thing Ivan Allure bed under the rug is sometimes I talk in my local condition and sometimes have been remember for an appointed view of infra I'm literally doesn't matter right so in particular if I give you a photograph which right remember which is not necessarily I can Anderlecht still define a distribution I simply just normal eyes all the weights a month r don't yz250 these objects are actually called Fields which is another object of study spice this is actually more general way to think about the relationship distribution Ronnie mostly Focus but some examples will be more ok so you have this distribution and so you can go with this demo in the slide click there this yellow.dot shows you the observation at a particular point and the noise are the observation is related to the true position of some particle by based on the noise that you define arrive define bark noise which means that it's going to be a uniform distribution over a boss I guess it's like and so if I increase the number of particles to housing then what I'm going to show you read blob that looks like it's trying to eat the yellow Door and this is red blood show you a the set of Paris word intensity is the count of that number this one I can't record man still on the board metaphorical I'm better since is disc retires UK just to see how all this is doing preposition you can see the Blue Dot is actual object yellow dyed is the Noisy observation and is trying to do its best aqua shopify because this is the price now any questions about particle theory the summarise you can do for a backward if you can swallow computing or number of a domain if you have large domains by you really think that most of antimatter in particle filtering is a good too because allows you to focus your energies on the roller ok so now let's revisit Gibbs sampling from a problem so remember that something we talked about last as a way to compute the maximum weight assignment in tachograph where the main purpose is to get out of local I'm so remember how give something worse you have a weight which is the fine complete assignments so am I parkour filtering you're being search were starting with complete assignments and trying to modify the AutoTrader I'm so you live and are you compute you pick up a very wet site and then you can sit all the possible I'm possible values that could take on and you choose other value with Connolly proportional let me show you this last week so engracia restore with this a Simons arm and then we can examine x 1 S1 take on Chipotle use of his eyes and go in a computer it's wait I remember and give sampling I only need to consider the Markov blanket of that variable as the factors you're r01 nt1 because that's the only thing that changes every and then normalize and sample Jordan next variable sweep across all the variables eventually the way not always up because sometimes I might sample and at the same time I can do various things like on computing the the marginal distribution overall a particular girl off to TV so I can basically count the number of times I see particular pattern and I can normalise that together so now let's try and interpretive something from a probabilistic innserve just thinking about a week just a function I think about the probability distribution induced by that I could buy again tell me all the way to France normalise the way the thing that gives ample ing is Now more succinctly amour actually traditionally written as the following which is you look taller variable and for every variable you're going to look at the probability of atom or taking on a particular value condition on every and I can give them right down this probability which is a nice way to think about what a Giffgaff and the issue with Gibbs sampling under I won't get into that as you run this for a long enough you are the sample that you got is actually you sample from this as if you had samples multiple times now you can actually compute any sort of Martin wilders that County sounds really nice situations work if sampling can take exponential time ok so let's look at a possible application of Gibbs sampling suppose you have some Sara noisy Imogen you want it clean Arkansas so we can model this image denoising problem as I'm the spectrograph wear I'm you have a grid of pixel values arm and connected in this kind of way every XII is where I the location number is going to be either 01 arm and we're going to assume that some subsequent pixels are up in case we observed then we're actually just going to have natural that is actually constraint that says that are you excited an are these we have is transition potentials that say neighbouring pixels are more likely to be the same science value 2 pixels which are the same in one ok is the Mothercare let's try to do give something in this I think if you're on concrete WhatsApp on look at not going to draw the entire the Grinch but I'm going to send her around a particular know that we're interested so I meant remember again give sampling at any point in time all the variables have something Fulham area wine wine 0 in decimal so now I switch through and I'm going to pick up this variable and going to say sorry trailer changes you know that doesn't and now you're going to consider so XI there's two possible I'm value of 0 and 1 Prezzo I'm going to look at weight so if it's 0 then I'm going to evaluate each of these factors based on that remember the transition potential is on but what's considered 0 these are different I mean I'm going to get a 1 and these are different that's going to be a wine is there different and these are the same and I'm going to get it no I try one these are the same these are the same these are the same these two are different I'm so obvious I may have this way to this is to this is 8 and then I normalise so this is going to be pointed Who I draw flip a coin with head whatever I get find a probability and here's another example which if something is going to do that so now let's look at this concrete so ok so what you're looking at here is the spread of pixels arm white means add the pixels on black or red means that it's observed to be whatever colour be honest and also this is somewhat of a noisy and the goal is to fill in the Excel solver visual you guys control work at hidden your system is I'm going to run gifs and what you're saying here you generation I'm going to go through every pixel and apply exactly that what am I doing on so you can see that these are the samples from the Observer to turn this into something more useful you can instead of looking at a particular sample you look at arm the marginal which is for every location what is the average little value that I've seen and if you do that then you can see your little bit clearer picture of it and it's not going to be perfect because the model that we have fairly simplistic similar pixel neighbouring pixels and have the same colour as known as but you can see cannabis in bags there's a bunch of primers you can play with on you can play around with a coherent which is how thick either condition constraint r which one ok so just two kind of sum up last week Mondays Redefined new model so we define divisional without a graph today were focused on the question of how do we do a problem for a sunset models externally how to do this there's a number of algorithms nao a for backward which 140mm exact particle filter in which works for H&M so they can be generalised which is approximate and Gibbs sampling which works for general Electric risotto each of these algorithms with c these ideas in previous incarnation so forward backward is very similar to terrible animation because it's also cute things exactly an horrible trainers lightning search things that smell and Gibbs sampling is like condition mode which are saffron sfr next Monday we're going to look at How We Do learning so up until now the bayesian network all the probabilities are sick and now we're going to actually start to do learner I should say that maybe this learning sounds a bit scary because there's already a lot of machinery behind in France and facts the Stuffed but you'll be pleasantly surprised that learning is actually much simpler than
