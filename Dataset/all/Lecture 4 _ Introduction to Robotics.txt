this presentation is delivered by the Stanford centre for professional development let's get started so today video segment is about a small device called the hummingbird the hummingbird was developed at IBM Watson Research Center in early 90s and it was published in the proceedings of April 1992 the hummingbird Mini positioner is a compact device designed for the ultra high-speed positioning of Lomas payloads developed for the contact and non-contact probing of planar object I can prove it over 50 cycles per sec with accelerations exceeding 50 G's the five bar linkage of the mini positioner covers a 13 mm Square workspace to reach larger regions the entire mini position and can be moved the two main links are driven by high-performance moving coil actuators and 9 positions are sent by Lomas optical encoders preloaded bearing pairs of the joys provide high stiffness and 0 back for accurate XY positioning and a miniature linear servo motor provide 1 mm of ZX is travel the hummingbird system can generate peak accelerations of 50 to 100 years in all three axes to avoid shaking the structure holding a mini position the mechanism is designed to be reactionless during X Y motion the dynamically balanced linkage assembly generates no net XY reaction forces during motion because the net centre of gravity of the moving part remains fixed for all linkage orientations the Nazi axis reaction generated by the to link actuator is actively cancelled by a third rotary actuator which oscillates only very slow because of a Thai rotary inertia when is many applications for high-speed probing is the electrical testing of high density circuit boards when driven by a custom multi transputer silver controller the hummingbird can provide such testing at unprecedented rates 40 test per second as shown here the camera and the human eye are unable to follow the promotion the use of a strobe light however reviews the three large XY moves and the small z-moves in this repetitive pattern hear a pattern of smaller moves onto 125 micron Grey is being demonstrated at only 10 test for s 2 quadrants of the greater probe systemically while the other quadrants approached only partially but more randomly that same pattern is being probed for a second and finally the complete 372 move pattern is performed a full 50 test per second details of the motion as shown in the high-speed video being replayed 33 times slower than real time each probing cycle include 1XY and 20 20 Ms to complete using a total of 150 distinct moves per second at this speed the XY pro placement accuracy is approximately 5 microns to provide a more familiar size bed the Proby shown here by some ordinary table salt the hummingbird was programmed to contact each three selected grains at 39 different locations a rate of 50 probes per second the inset shows one of the soft greens after probe and the characters phone by the tip the letters about 140 - 2 what's the typical spacing of 20 microns unbelievable positioner resulted from the interdisciplinary team effort of these and many other contributors so unbelievable well obviously when you want to move verify you have to make everything very low in order to achieve that if you have moving structure is going to be impossible and now integrating all the structure in away where you can get all the stiffness vibration it's not a simple ok well today's election really now is going to take what we have learnt about frame of sign into the description and take the to a manipulator what we going to do is we're going to take this manipulator and start by looking at a link and try to see how we define the Sling and from the description with going to introduce this description I mentioned earlier the DH parameter or the denavit-hartenberg notation that with H to describe the link and it's connections to the next or previous this is going to allow us to then precisely define the frames that are going to move with the leg that will also allow toucan the base through the structure to the interfactor so that it will give us the forward kinematics the hurricane is the relationship between the Lost frame and the best friend you remember we talked about this end effector please add some location in space connected through those links do the bits so if we have a frame here if we have a frame of the end effector of this to radar in between you have all these things and all of them are moving and the question is how are we going to define does France how we're going to attach frames to different things obviously you can go to each of the link and say ok I'm going to go to the centre of mass of the link and put a frame and you still have freedom in assigning that but that will be fine then you will have to find the relationship between frame on the base link 1 with euro selected frame and the next frame of the next frame so if you think about it let's say I'm going to put friends and the centre of mass this is just one example what is going to happen in term of the relationship between two successive frames how many parameters we're going to need to describe the these two friends any idea well you have frame another frame you have a homogeneous transformation how many parameters sex now this link we know it's moves just with one degree of free and there are restrictions right so if we just go and place friends and victory at the centre of mass or any other point we're not going to take advantage of the fact that there is some set of constraints associated with this makina so the purpose of what we going to do is really to take advantage of those constraints and come up a minimal description that allow us to somehow emphasize this variable this joint variable that is rotating and have it explicitly in the so what we going to do we will start with the description and then we take a look at the link connection and from there we will identify the parameters and we will identify the variable some of the parameters are the length of the Lyng is 4 the relationship between axe so if we think about axis I and access I'm -1 there is some fix relationships right as we move this access there are some parameters that are constant what kind of parameters are cancer what's what do you see that as constant between these two is there list basically success or maintaining a and in general these actors are not parallel so there is a child between them and that child is going to be maintain and there are some offsets that will be there is an angle that is taking place that we cannot see it with just the access we need to assign the frame and we will start to see that so the link description I'm going to take to access and arbitrary axis so that we will not the just take parallel the parallax case so axis I - 1 and access I all connected somehow through this link so if we take a link at the extremities of the link we have the joint acts ok so what are the things that artists so you said distance how is the going to define the distance between two x Mark Foster so perpendicular perpendicular to a plane perpendicular to an axis that we have to ask so it is I Common common perpendicular line something that is vertical to both that was measured that so if we take this common for particular to botox then we have I sort of I mean this is going to be unique right except if the axis are parallel when you have infinite way of placing that comment ok you agree with that selection that makes sense we take the common perpendicular and that will give us this list we call it so now you have to pay attention to the notation because we will going to describe link I - 1 with the parameter a I'm in which is the common perpendicular to those to access so I minus one is the common perpendicular between access I'm -1 and I what else we need to introduce so if I slide axis I along this common perpendicular and I come to the there will be an angle a twist angle this angle you see it we slide it up to the intersection and there will be an angle we call it the link Twist and it is the parameter alpha minus which measures this angle and what we will do is we measure the angle along the Victor AI - 1 in the right hand and you're going to learn how to use your everyone knows how to measure the angle in the right hand make sure use your right hand so we have two parameter Factor we're going to see that in total we need for parameters one of them is valuable the joint angle older during this placement stop is nothing and now we don't Defy 2 alpha and a are constant all the time so once you design your robot this offers alpha 0 Alpha 1 two alpha in all going to become the same for now if we look at most mechanisms what you going to see that the axis are not always apart what are the time they are parallel and sometimes they are intersex so we think the poem you have this first joined access and then you have the second one and they are interest if you take the rest you have three intersecting so when we have intersecting axis the question is what is the common normal so you have this axis intersecting where is the common normal so we take the plane phone by I -1 and I and take a perpendicular to that plane and that will be a vector perpendicular to both which Direct so we have this anger how would you find because I can take a vector in the plane or out of the plane and that changes the direction of the so we have sort a free variable hair to the side in which direction we're going to select Alpha the picky what we do is you have the base and you're moving toward the end of factory so you are putting this a the the the Victor a you are fighting the eight thoughts the end of so it is very interesting to to create does vectors and once you have a define then you will be able to to say well it is in that direction and now I think the end inside or if it is in this Direction you will take the others that's for alpha now what we going to do next is to connect to the Sterling so we defined the link through this to access the distance between them become a norm and The Twist if we no further we're going to have another link now that other link will have another common normal right and this common normal will be between axis I and axis I + 1 soda the common-law will intersect with access write intersect at some location with access so we know this point where we have this interest now what we need to do is to introduce two other parameters that define nose connections and obviously this is perpendicular to the axis eye so I don't know if you see this vector how can you define the vector with respect to this line a that is I use this colour can you see it if you see this reflector ok and you see this factor what are the variables that we need to introduce the define play swing music angle between yeah that is an angle between the two dots and this angle can be found if we slide this vector to the plane we will find it this is going to be so when the link that following link is rotating we will see this access rotating with it and that angle increases and decreases and there is one more parameter which is the distance this off so what we will do is we will rejected this vector on that an intersection point and then we can measure the Di and now you can see the end so di is defined by as the leak of said and this di is going to be constant for revolut joint for prismatic joint is really the direction along with the joint is going to affect the motion of the following so di will be viable if the giant Express mat sell for revolut joint Peter is the volume so like in this figure the this is a revolut joint as in here this data will be the volume so pleased that I is called the joint angle and it's variable for Revolution basically now we have everything that we need for each of the leg and if we identify alfa-a die and data we will be able to go from one frame to the next as we are such friends here friends there and properly so here is a shorter movie segment if we could put the light little bit please lower the light so we have this money for later and it was designed to show you different properties about different angles Ender you see the interfactor moving recurring an object so we see access I've joined to join 3 4 5 6 so you have all this axis of rotation and now the Lost giant little go and go back to the beginning so we one access here we have another access there and you see the distance Roscommon normal do you see it listen to common normal so as we move this this is fixed but basically that and this is the angle between the acts so what we going to do is along this first access we going to attach a frame we will see that in more details and along the X Direction along the common normal we put the x axis so now here is a case of common normal between two parallel access there are many many possibilities but we are not going to make the commitment of the assignment and to replace the neck joy you'll see there is this point and we do not want to introduce this road so we will move the common normal there this are the rules that we will see in our frame assignment now that we decided this that will decide the race and little by little we build that structure that would allow us to do the frame assignment so now we are signing the frames and the friends are assign long as the axis most of the time at the intersection between axis or long become common normal so this is the frame a sign here for this joint and when we rotate the next giant you have this angle so you have another friend when you're ready about this all this frames are assigned with the same orange this is the 3 intersecting x you see that now there is always an additional frame that goes for the average and I often wear a sign it depending on the task or them so you end up with a structure like this basically this friend and each of them is rotating just with one variable from there you can go and then build your connection from the base to the interfactor and as your end effector is moving is covering the space so in the just coming here you can start to see the Workspace of the this is what we call the Workspace of the road the space where the interfactor can be positioned given the joint limits given the structure of the robot there are areas inside of this that will not be reachable because there are joint limits on the different joints and you cannot be able to access all this so the Workspace is this volume of the space where we can position the end of factory and usual we will discuss this later about the definitions of the word space but this is basically what is going to happen intimate how you define the word space where are these configuration that are not reachable because of the joint limit and because of the the different lines do you have on your structure so this is this is an example of the Workspace that we need to study in order to position the base of the robot so that then the factor of the robot can reach in different area ok let's go back to the Lyng so now that we discussed this intermediately and their connections we need to do to be a little bit concerned about how we define the beginning of the structure that is the frame do the bay and how with you also with the lost link and there is a lot of freedom there this freedom comes from the fact that those frames can be can be assigned and moved as long as you are able to find a friend that is fair with respect to that rigidbody so we saw that 4-axis I access I plus 1 we are taking the common normal so we are taking does twist angles and if we think about it this AI and Alpha are depending on I and I + 1 so when we say AI the definition of AI and alkali is going to depend on axis I and axis I + 1 which means bad from 1 to n having those access will determine A1 2 a n - 1 and alpha 12 alpha and -1 then now we have to somehow decide about what is a 0 and a n what is alpha zero and alpha in and that comes from the way we define the frame attach to the last link and the first link there are many different conventions and does conventions can-can very following your task and requirement that essentially what we try to do is to to carry in the Fallout kinematics the maximum number of 0 parameter because when you an alpha angle 30 or 40 or whatever you need to compute the cosine and sine and that introduces more constant so what you need to do to try to sete select your your friend in away makes a 0 a n = 20 that will simplify the for kids alphazero and alpha into vehicles and we can do it here so this access one and we have access 2 and 3 sofa access zero accessories is essentially connected to the it's free with respect to them but it has a freedom of being define so what you can do is your actually you can move this access and make it parallel to access one and you can even make incident with access one and now you can buy make putting them along the same axis you are setting a 0 and alpha 020 so that simplifies the number of parameters you're carrying in your forward Kinema obviously you might need a different frame the different frame can be computed with respect to this frame that you are introducing my accountants transformation and you can do that separately you don't have to to carry it in the Ford Kinema so for the end of factory the problem of the end effector is that you your interfactor is doing many different things you are carrier carrying a tool and now you need to compute the forehead kinematics to this phone you your fork and change you are carrying just this and your task is to control this phone audio you're you're carrying a eggless and your description is really related to this option so I'll probably will need a an imp frame by the task itself but in the forward kinematics the frame in can be Simply Be most of the time can be obtained simply by going to the intersection point associated with the rest and there you get the simplest form of that disc well this is not all the time the case I mean sometimes we we we we give you specify will I need this for and I want you to find that transformation to that so you can do in that but in general this frame that is associated with the tool we at with Origin o n plus one that is frame.in Plus can be originally placed with respect to that lost rigidbody and it depends on the toll you're carrying or object your hands so for the last name that is for frame and and access and what we're going to do is we're going to remove this frame in the same way and make it confident with with axes and which means that we will have a n and I find equal to zero and that simplify again the following coronavirus so Mrs the summary that we are really moving all these frames and we are putting the frames for all fine day the first one and the last one to 0 we still have to decide also about the data and the dbk Peter ind I depend on I -1 and I and that means essentially that now with the five a tattoo to say that in -1 and D2 to the and minus one so we still have the data 1D 1 L in India and also will be fixed once we decide those other acts so the conversation again is so you remember l i n d i one of the 2 is cancer Street I could be the viable the angle theta save the animals by the variable if it is a religion so in that case di is DN base so what you want to do it to set the constant parameter Hayter or di2 B01 has to be volume so that means the variable is the one then we make potato one if the variable is the one we make later 1 equal to 0 and that is the variable we make the 1 equals so here is an example for the first time what we will do is we will we we selected the access we reduced those parameters alpha and a but now that we will do we will move the point that would become the origin of the frame we will move do the same point of the intersection reducing this is the one so there is no more the one and the one becomes 0 so this is by moving the access or actually orienting that access so to make theta 1 equal to for the last link we are going to do the same thing we are going to reduce how far and a and make the selection of the point of that access to reduce either DN or heater in my selecting the direction of that frame because the last frame associated with that virtual axis in plus 1 is not yet defined so when you define it you define that so the result is CDN or data in becomes equal to tell Widnes we with this convention and those for parameters now we can essentially I mean basically we defined the DH parameters the denavit-hartenberg parameters I in fact those four parameters that we just saw that is how far is AI Di and heater you have four parameters defining east of the links and is what three of those parameters I'm going to be constant one of them is Valium so in the case of prismatic joint play that I will be the variable in the case of revolute joint DIY will be the volume the first parameter the one will be set to if we have revolut joint D1 will be set to what 0 if it is up is Maddie joy say that one will be set to 0 the same thing for DN by the type of the jaw so as I said three fixed link parameters and when joined Viber and this variable is either I or Di play the eye for the revolut case and Di for the present so as we said the first two of this parameter Alpha and a are describing the link because we have the link and we have the two acts and the distance AI the Ovi the sky Netflix what about D&C what do they do basically the sky how a link is connected to the next you have one link and D will give you the translation between them if this is a prismatic joint you have one link I've got another link and you're describing the transit 3D if it is revolut link it is going to be this angle so Di and DDA describe the links connection that is we go from one linked to the next and how we can now then it is really through this di or take one of them is boring now you know the DH parameters actually I won't ask her and probably the homework well involve computing finding this ds400 you take a link and you go and 5-alpha i a i d i and you go through all the links and once you have them basically you need to use them to compute your transformation so we need somehow to use this parameters in our definition of the phrase that we are going to attach so that when we go from one frame to the we are able to describe the relationship using those parameters so the frame attachment is a very I mean it will become for you very simple once you did the fuel queue example but it's very important because the way you are attached your friend you will simplify or make it more and we are going to very carefully look at this problem and make sure as we as the frame we are going to use these parameters in the homogeneous transformation describing the relationship between two successive friends and then we will be able to to have that transformation then we propagate transformations and we can compute the end effector whether respect to the base frame by multiplying out all this homogeneous transformation so how do we proceed with the framer any help what should we do where should we stop pickle French what is what what is a frame what is what is the most critical thinking about the origin someone said Orange so we we really need to decide a rule about Howie we select the origin of those French and we also need to decide something about the write a frame the origin and the axe so you have x y and z and have to make some decision also about the access so any any good idea what what what selection you would do for your x axis on Wi-Fi what's the axis what convention you were going to you need to do something systematic so if you're not interested what we did we selected I minus one and I and we said this all the access and we are looking at the distance between them and the offset between the so this access has a very important role you want your frame to be aligned with those right so you went the joint access 222b the axis that define your one of the factors based X Y or Z let's quickly pick XY or which one altogether so what we will do is it's really simple you have I mean you booked your mechanism you designed it now you hunting access just along this axis I'm going to pick the zodiac alright so so we already we already make me this is that's if we bring with the access now once you pick the Z axis are you you if you pick the x-axis their intersection is the origin or if you you think about where the origin has to be then you have little bit of freedom that basically you're almost done so so the z-axis along the joint angle is very interesting why because later when when you are going to rotate consent about a joint immediately you measure the angle theta about that axis and that is your joint angle and that's going to be very soon and if the actors are well selected you will end up with just one transformation so we are going to take the origins as you suggested and this origin has two again makes use of the information we we we just displayed Windows 10 w what is unique about those parameters we said we are using the common normal this point of intersection with the common normal is very important so now we're going to take the origin of our frames at the intersection with the common normal this is this the frame that will be a sign of long I - 1 and this intersection point is very important where is the next important point I know you cannot point because you don't have any point or just try to describe it to me The xx I said this is the first origin of this frame now there is another frame here for the next joint where where will the origin is going to be here as the intersection of the common normal with this point light on if you understand this yeah what it is but it's very important that mean sometimes you you if you selected down there you urine into a lot of other problems you're not using the di parameter properly and everything becomes so ok we take the intersection of the common normal with each of the axis and pick that point as the Irish simple you remember that then we take the z-axis to be along vagina that's all so simple -1 will be the final long axis I mind and other one I was sleeping ok so what is the define the frame xx so when do we do with the so we know the origin end what you going to say the x-axis has to be somehow orthogonal to Z and you are proposing to take this orthogonal to be along a minus one because this axis a -1 is orthogonal to Z I - 1 because it is it is the axis orthogonal to the joint so we take and we take it in this Direction I think I will problem is solved now because we are signed we we we pick the origin we pick this he will pick the X the why is define in the right hand rule so in this case where is why y - 1 it is inside the plane right xyz you know this road like this you have to use your hand over this year if you end up with the like the opposite frame audio transformation is going to be wrong ok good and excited is along there no we need to verify that we can go from Zi - 12 Zi using the disk for parameter do you think this is possible so we have to free we are fine to friends and we should be able to describe this frame with respect to this that is the homogeneous transformation uniquely using this parameter and we will do it in just shortly but there is no problem we should be able to do ok this simple oh well illustration of the frame assignment is much more complicated because there are all these special cases where you have intersecting axes you have parallel access and you have that last frame that is still not the fine so you you have to to see where to define it and you freedom that is added and you have to make your select and that's why the convention of always reducing getting 0 parameters so when you doing that assignment you're going to run into a lot of special cases hopefully we will stand them in your homework midterm and final so you will be mastering bass problem so always remember this right hand roll William Bertram try to practice with it if you you're not coming over so the summary for the frame attachment is the following is we pick the normals ok so you have to access your big ginormous take intersection and pick the origins along origins you place your axis and then you defined as accessed along becoming normal and that's do you have these forceps finding the normals the common normals finding the original there intersection taking the Z axis a longer joint axis from the point of the agency select and then placing The xx ok now where is the x-axis please from the intersection point to the next link let's see the case of sector join the axis which have video of an individual learning and the end of the mechanism the beginning that usually joint 1 and 2 r intersect and the Joy four five and six oranges I mean in in 6 degree of freedom latest because we use rest with the three intersecting join the Mechanics of that is is well understood and quite is it too big and also the there are a lot of advantage internal the Workspace and the free except they have problems with respect to singularities as we will see later in when we study decor especially we're going to run into this so we know this point and what we said is that well we we picked the intersection we pick the origin and now this is the origin for frame I and replace the Z axis but the question is where do you select your x-direction and define your so if your place your XI in this Direction your angle twist angle will be measure about that so it will be in this sentence this Direct and if you place it in the opposite direction this is One Direction if you place it there you go a different definition of your alpharad that is fine because whatever you do you have this feeling when was your place XI you define your alpha and you are going to carry that transformation through the propagation and this will be captured in your in your transformation and because you are going to find the next transformation between XI to the next one everything will work so that freedom will be accounted for you can come up with a description that used the minus sign or the plus sign and that will work out with the next joint then exchange will account for it and everything will work you had a crush so that this direction and the sign of Alpha depends on your speaking effects so here is so and example of the first link I'm taking a revolut link what we would like to do for a revolut link if the first joint is revolut like in the case of the former what you would like to do is to almost say that the fixed frame and the moving frame are identical when Stata is equal to 0 so so you are really setting a alpha to be zero and do you want equal to 0 for the revolut Joint and the only variable is data and the zero fighter is when the two friends are event and that gives you the the simplest form so as you rotate about this joint you are measuring feet from zero to the value of faith ok for a prismatic joint what you are saying is I'm going to take the two friends to be dentico this is this is impose this is your selection of the best and you are replacing the frame so that when these two are identical D1 the prismatic joint do you have a translation up and down measured by this valuable and Wendy 1 is equal to 0 when do you want is equal to 0 you you have the two friends concert so this is the friends around the femoral denticle Wendy 1 equal to zero your valuable right for the last link if we have overlooked think we are going to sell we we are going to select the frame so that the DNA equal to 0 which depends on the following frame that is we are seeing DM equal to zero and that frame just measure the angle theta and and went and equal to 0 basically we have accent and in -1 and 6 in Ireland FIFA matches this angle between the x-axis basically as Europe 8 and for the prismatic Joint we do the same thing to set later in 20 that is we have when DNA CO2 0xn comes down to be aligned with in mind so list all the conventions that you are going to try to enforce in your frame assignment using this you will end up with the simplest form of the hurricane Amanda but then as I said again the tool frame that you will add you will add one more frame that will account for your task and what is Nice is once you have all this relation between the base frame and then free all the other transformation are Council that is the next transformation will only involve Council parameter so it is very simple transform let's see the total summary now so what we say it is we need to introduce for it joined we need to introduce these four parameters aita leave the end Di ent what AI is doing AI is measuring the distance between A-frame VR and I'm sorry between access Di and access CI plus one along the XI how far I measures the angle between access Zi and access VI + 1 about the xix in the writing sete Di measure the distance between the x axis x - 1 and XI along the Z I access and Peter measures the angle between the x-axis about 0 now this summary is very very useful make a copy of this and keep it next to you you're going to be confused about the eyes you are using and about the definition of this make sure that you have a copy of those definition not far away and you will see that this is very used so Indian definitions we have two distances and two angle a and Dr distance a measure distances between the Z axis d measure distances between the x along the opposite ok how far and Sita measure angles between the Z axis and XX about the others know what is important is to note the fight between looking at the eye I + 1 and here we looking at XI - 1 x 4 DDA so be careful with wish I will f****** you're confused enough to make a copy of a drive yeah I think it is rarely used so nipsa take an example very simple I'm going to take a plane or robot n displaying a robot is just set up free joined so we are talking about data one play tattoo and Theatre Surrey so where are the giant axe someone made a sign I think I am stupid everyone do you see the joint axis so they joined access are coming perpendicular to the plane ok so how do we speak the origin in order to pick the origin so you see 3 parallax so how do we pick the origin what do you do you need the common normal right so you have between two parallel axis many possible common normal that's because this is in the plane we are going to use the common normals in that plane we should the plane of this screen so where are the common normal from this access to the next one to the next do you see it basically this is the first common normal the second common normal and if there was afraid there that would be so you know the common normals directly so if you have the common or the common number are intersecting at this point so the common normal is intersecting here resetting there there and this will become the origin of the prefer French that we are going to us sofa frame exhale mean frame one the common normal is intersecting here the Z1 will be out of the page x 1 is along the common normal and why won't complete the director frame so musically you have this as the first frame right any question about the MiDAS ok do you agree with this second one extor is along the common normal and Z2 is coming out of the plane and why to complete The Fray end are placing the lost friend we have the Z3 and we are placing the origin so X3 is taking along the direction perpendicular to the c-axis and along the directions to L3 and that measures the angle theta so between these friends the only variables that you're going to see it Play-Doh 9283 now you need to introduce the first frame so for the first frame we said we are going to simplify we are not going to select ASDA 0 hours I mean in an arbitrary Direction whistle 80 along Z1 so this way we will select the x02 vehicle incident with X1 when tater 1 is equal to 0 and data one is measured from here so x 0 will be alarm this Direct 2simple alright so with this famous Simon what we going to have is the following we defined for each of the joint those parameters and now we have to identify those parameters and make sure for 1234 6 whatever number of degrees of freedom step-by-step we are writing down this parameter so we fall for a table and this table is like this you have alpha -1 A A - 1 that describe the links dinp that I described the connection of this link with the next one and we say joint I won self-adjoint I alpha zero is equal to 0 that is no angle between 0 and 0 1 no distance no no no distance between the two 0 no offset 0 and only valuable is Peter 1 so we're going to go through the one by one and because of the fact that in this case the only variables that are going to be introduced or do to L1 L2 so L1 measure sweat which variable is measured by L1 the AA and that means A1 is going to BL1 and a who is going to BL2 end basically now we have the description and the connection of oestrogen so we build this table now you have to notice something very important is that how far we set the value of 0 reset the value this Arkansas be in this case so we said the value four-seater I didn't measure I didn't go and measure this is 32 degrees and SITA 1 replace it with 32 degrees because this is going to move so I'm in this table unsetting the variable the second joint was a prismatic joint the d will not appear as a 0 but it will appear as a variable so that will be a variable depending on the type of guy usually we add one more column the column where we we say configuration song in the configuration shown you set the value of the variable data one in the in the configuration shown is equal 32 degrees you put 32 degrees in that column if needed and sometimes we ask you to measure that variable but now windows for km and this table we should be able to describe the four kinematics that is we should be able to describe the position and orientation of the factories how do you get the yeah right now I'm going to frame free now the transformation from frame free to the that point that blue Point in was another transformation and sometimes we are sign a frame for and we put for here and then you can find out information before now we are just looking at this point this is the response and the variable is already in the response the only thing is a translation that is constant ok we ready we're going now to find the transformation between two friends and once we found one transformation using this parameter we will generalize and we will we will multiply out all the transformations and find for kids everyone ready let's go stop so here is a free my and I'm going to compute the transformation from I - 12 frame on angry have this for permit and you're going to help me to do it we need for transformation 4 km I'm going to use again I can do it directly but I'm going to use for Transformers I was the one at the time so I think about Di as an operator and now if I use this di as an operator I basically Wide from I to some other frame that just use this transformation from here to here so this will be a frame here then I repeat this frame buy cedar then slide it by a and then tilted by Alpha and I have four transformation for simple transformation that will give me the double transformation very so let's do it so transformation I'm going to call this transformation that takes me from I down to PCP and then we introduce The Cure rotating to 2-days and then we go here to see our and then we talk VR 2ci - so basically the way we're going to do it we will move from this frame to this frame do this frame cure this frame and slide it up and read this the transformation between each of them involves only one operator so what is the operator between CI and Zippy universe operators that I think we called q cure of the of the so this queue is along the Z axis with a Distance d i the second one is a rotation about the Z axis with angle theta the next one is a translation about the X Factor the next one is a rotation about the x-axis and that will lead us to so if I find the transformation from itpp 2QQ to our auto - 1 then the total transformation between my transformation and this is the most important thank you have once you have this expressed in terms of the a these alpha and beta then you have a general transformation that you can use in all your frames and then you can build you hurricane so this one as I said translation about the z-axis with Di this one is a rotation about the Z axis with data this one is translation 1 basic cells with a minus one and this one is rotation about the axis with alpha minus just multiply them out you get to transfer me and this transformation is simply this so you have the answer is don't have to do it how the answer look eye-to-eye - 1 is given as a function AI - 1 - 1 d i n Seder metcheck so we have this one my genius transformation between this first frame and final frame and now we can apply it once we have this parameters that is once we found the stable reapply this transformation we know those parameters we have the homogeneous transformation once you have one of those transformation you can go and x transformation between friend you start from frame and and you go all the way to friends error and you have your transformation homogeneous transformation from N20 which is now function the parameters that are constant of the links the essays and how far is and Dior and the valuables Dior and with that you have this information about the position of the end of factory which is contained in this transformation the last Factor remember the last factor of this transformation contain x y and z and the rotation matrix in this transformation contains the orientation of the frame with respect to the first so you have your favourite dinner great do we have a homework today ok so you going to do we have we have something about going to have fun this weekend see you next next Monday
