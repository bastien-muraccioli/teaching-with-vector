so are we talking today about my work in sword applying machine learning techniques to systems that we would like to control and feedback and wondering about robotics guarantees their and specifically today I'm going to focus on the case of perception biscuit work with a bunch of my colleagues at Berkeley Nikolai band Rohan in Vicky without some of the would not exist machining is a promising tool for processing complex information that's why you talking about it that's why everybody is excited about it some of the successes are in areas like is recognition are detection and in Translation and what areas have in common is that the inputs are four of this weird that may not be clear how to process otherwise it's a learning provide something powerful where you can take data sets weather excited about using this tool to actually act on the covert information about the role that recent so one example is in Games video games what was one that people that really excited about it where in this case the information is given by the board and the positions on the board and learning was a really important part of understanding how to value different port configurations a different move we're also putting in aerial acrobatics to reply condition capabilities to sort of control things in real-time example of manipulating a queue with let me like a pulling out of millions of years between but in the end there were some pretty cool videos a reliable procedure to do so broadcast like I think two years now had a few fatalities from cars driving a timeless mode including a uber and Tesla both from problems does like maybe examples that are more abstract systems like you two were criticized for having might radicalise individuals were watching the assistant have in common is that they are learning components in feedback with the Railway what is challenge in caring why is it unreliable still when is that in the world don't have four state observation you don't have work out this process in general we have some kind of partially observed decision process distribution chef once you use a learnt component to act on the world you're changing the world around you and this changing the day that would be put back into that when I come play both of you think 40 contribute to a lack of robust can you don't have operation robot-assisted here and when they should be there changing your bottles of heartache that's going to be the motivation for Saturday and everything going to say from here now it will be for a targeted at this example of racing from pics what year is to drive around arbitrary Patrick as fast as possible using just a dashboard matter because in the situation army pushing against performance limit as we get faster and faster and that will let us understand why using components for a camera this and that totally realistic if you want to make a car that drives around if I have a lot more census as you can do with lot of careful work that has been done in robotics the weather is models for control physics say that we do nothing about the world we do understand how the road change Centre Diner volume 4% on the case of a good working odometry what suppose that we would like putting more general approach we don't have to care Drive cameras or environment your family we just want to win that from dealer and so this approach can be fixed either I'll show a video like that again at the end of the talking explained in more detail but this is an example of a 1/10 size RC car driving around through this track to find by this so this is what the dashboard camera view looks like thereafter using for control chainsaw preposition comes from doing a look location with it on so can't really use phone but I can also feel so sometimes when you're out the car drive around the small office space if we don't get to rent turn the carnon actually the question is enter that today by framing the problem and more simple fighting then reality but something that can hopefully illustrate was going on so I'm going to start with setting up this problem that's my problem and show how it relates to output feedback after work my model example of a car that we would like to move over to the the story play Partners in reaction to something so this is ethical and then we can write the derivative of velocity acceleration and the positions glossary turn off read out some organisation problem that describes my desire for the car to move quickly but without too much input for play Wires by we have some minimising minimization of a cost function subject to some noon sometimes problems that uses sometimes are in situations really maybe the thing as clear but a lot of the time models we have a good party for the car EZ when states are directly under zinsser the driving example that I just showed her what about other things that we don't have the 6 directly turn has some observation does cost and design mfa the same as before and deliver McDonald's what's different is that Z is some high-dimensional observation from the world can you take the liner control at axon so isolation I'm guessing for the problem that exist in the world and Newton local things 120 Pro 2 relies on physical modelling to sort of reducing complexity by doing state estimation in here you would do some kind of maybe extended Kalman filter with your take into account the Dynamics and this through like this appearance map which map of steep I don't reckon graphic but I know that that's an entire of your research so this IKEA complexity Ashton-under-Lyne can you control on an estate as if we had systems workforce the model in part might be kind of annoying or maybe want to use sensors that you don't have the patience for you and you want to do some automatic calibration or something end-to-end approach where about Howard asking me to speak carefully and we can just use data to say what in the end of the day the procedure that I should hear is ultimately deciding the control action I can do the director and maybe if I haven't updated that something that would be I said already I'm going to talk about here which is something in the middle keeper Arsenal control problem change this observation from the witches Sam nothing 2y which is going to be much simpler maybe a linear function of the State Maker's Mark the car driving f is it an ex of the car xx is like the velocity and the position and perhaps why all the fine as just the I might not be able to get the velocity of the car from single image why should reliably be able to predict position CD controller all of these positions position history orbit so we have a black I don't like that the current environment generator image from that by passing it through a component we can then do output feedback 10 specifically what I talked about here linear setting we have linear dynamics activation model given by g like I said reduce the complexity by saying that instead we actually observed some linear subset of the State example position plus some error where these errors are now defined by you know that the composition of appearance perception - off and I'm trying this is so true by definition if you plug your things back together this is the weather going tomorrow and the reason is because look sorted familiar we have it sorted reception here which looks simple it looks like a 1-year control problem and then we have some perception error block that wouldn't have this is a familiar setting like I was getting at linear output feedback control and this is well studying and I know how many of you taking you know patients before and so depending on how we model the cost what are the processor is w and how many model the measurement noise there sort of Welsh Dragon Solutions that we could what's the most famous example of this would be the linear quadratic gaussian controller and so here would model gushing but remember our measurement noise is coming from this area in reception so there's no real reason to believe so we'll have to do it was thinking about go forward I'm really motivating the stock now with Lilly control in the situation where I'm saying is that my car find a low-level controller to follow for example Waypoint via Waypoint and I say how are you going to put all the Motors to get to that and often especially robotic and we think about how you might use a sensor like a camera it's not really that are thinking directly something like where you have a little have a Waypoint following controller will not really using the camera Huawei points based on past planner and you know if you want music that we're really closing no points as like this specific position I'll have a go like park in the corner and this kind of goal will be fed into the system turn the camera would be used along with the reception and pass data to decide how to set up waypoints that were maybe bring me to parking I bring this up just to save it good morning the rest of the talk with example remind that what I'm saying of any assistance that has this perception will be playable feedback I'm using somewhere components to make decisions by so with that said this before it's not a homosexual had a father when you have looking for problem so the first thing we talked about is not production errors perception component what are we doing images PlayStation because I'm worry about the composition of these two pieces I'm not focusing on map and how you where is characterized a sufficient condition for severe to get to in the section I think there's a lot of interesting ways that you can properties that are more specific networks or two odometry that I'll talk a little bit about at the end and more accurate just letting licious day we learn some map please States and image pictures of soon that we actually zero training data training area so that way to interpolate the training data turn the Caroline this past and collected training good at these please driver second class I would maybe expect that it should still you know be able to perceive its location for you driving all the way in the other direction in Crawley not so much why would I believe that Microsoft latest think about this safe that around training near weather perception performs well what is learning theory have to say about this about your training testing for germanisation you know exactly help with you so quick tour of what that has to say this is not the only way to learn things but it is how the most common play find my perception that sing some loss function where are all my data points are my data points in cixi States in minimise loss function over whatever is there empirical risk minimization so you are the son of the risk is a risk it's a cold becoming do it over and empirical when I care about is something like the population risk so not just what happens on the daytime serve but what happens from New data point of drawing from some distribution the approach says that I have a new data point drawn from the same distribution by Turning Point is that expected loss if my last word for on my training data what my testing data the same distribution again I can sort of that my -9 paracord complicated extraction and then I can send I said my training get a 10-in the skip it and possibly I'm really just standing things by this difference between you know the truth and the one thing I have I care about what the population nice case these are random pictures of an empirical distribution with a real distribution and because me lots of statistics over the years has been really beautiful now is as far as we can say that actually empirical distributions approximate tomorrow and we can maybe bound this value as one of us happy and it would say get my data we should have get better when you can try somewhere not dry new state of randomly and asking how are things going what happened at our distribution just because I drove the car and a circle theorem had no loss What if I've you off into the centre data point that don't necessarily work so good Arthur waste your precious Tesco prospect look outside of maybe the empirical risk over new distribution d-prime similar story to before but now you're concerned about the distance between the 2 l what does a statistical difference actually it's not really helpful in this setting because I don't have any of them playing I don't have I any dude I what I have is something in for you find a hold on to the stadium Tesco generalisation I'm going to think about it maybe deterministic or adversarial the closed-loop States the distribution of states that I will see John operating system depend on at reception about training the first I'm controlling the system so I actually have some say in what distribution is starting level 2 controller 32 in circles this really making a car drive around this area where this possible rape the way to ensure that perspective of your perception map in the area that has an idea of a slope slope bandon a composition of your appearance is based on where you are in a room so this may be like where are the chairs are what colours they are very comfy get visual features and format them against the database of feature than gas my position the appearance map might be somewhat smoothrite like I and that's why there's not that much of a difference what I see but it's really close to me then maybe that's ok time the perception map right is taking images position and so through the high-dimensional inputs doesn't necessarily being smooth right and that's why I think like adversarial images a really cute examples of like making a stop sign Pacifier think oh that's not what I'm asking to go and see in the situation I'm not asking it's off to be smooth just for the competition with the real world to be input real images that were generated that should very subtle smooth play message to get more general then smoothness that you can think of it as I can watch it Raising Hope can I have down areas around my as I move away from training appointment areas don't grow b places to say here that where the errors are traditional generalisation but it might feel very natural to a control engineer for eggs playing a region that we believe a safe and it really controller move forward into that part of his argue no have you have any reason let me think that we think weekend pretty of the road within how do we actually make sure we saying that Harry accident come into play us to ensure that the system stated in the face by the measurement error so just 5-years perception areas e have translate arthritis in performance by our goal is to drive a car on the road Baguley did you listen to the same time star approach to this so10 actually is based off of predictive control approach receding Horizon control that sort of optimises performance for some finite-time Horizon while satisfying certain constrain replant that every time but unfortunately it's a lot more difficult to get a handle on am I going to go to get this controller excusable in these types of arguments Tend To Be so using a different way to talk about a closed loop systems and robust control which is called system of Us does a approach to control design specifically than that from why is the measurement error so these two everything off it's any input service everything that's happening inside instead of worrying about just the controller ok about the forest can you do a brief introduction to this way of thinking about please for hopefully you'll see that by the end I think it's useful start with stinky back so remember in the sitting about could be back because we don't actually see the world perfectly because we have this weird something with for the purposes of introduction let's go back to sleep that's always a nice kiss any input of a system or actually just a linear function disturbance true remember that the state of the system is written in can be written in terms of the impact in the disturbance is the spice of unrolling at recursion but then because we have longer controllable ok as long as this is true well we have a controller we can also write the input as function of the state they put these two equations together Rangers actually just right to stay in the Empire as directly functions of that between what goes into the system what comes up what is going to be like in a little bit by a talking about sort of Signals and operators each acteon going to think about this sequence of all the exes it could be Infinite additionally attack in the matter I'm also nothing like the sequence of all the w the Sting here that's Fiats for you that sort of an operator that operate on the horizon signal other for a potentially infinite residency operator it's sort of what you would get from this expression is like a huge topic play Slayer Pollock main give me my face we can use this identity that I just write down the linear relationship to derive a new article control problem so control problem I have some cars so I'm going to write things now and terms Direct control because that's where everything is easy to re I minimise some quadratic cost subject to the Dynamics and subject to the control being a linear function of the State optimal control problem reform you like that in terms of Signals it doesn't look for different it actually beautiful my opinion I don't have to subscribe switch of annoying could I have the same things out of house party constraints and linear control I might actually also have stayed in Parkhurst really realistic for free also don't want to crash the car into a wall but you would actually to stay on the you know that my state and my input I just linear functional disturbance I could rewrite this whole thing just in terms of system responses that manufacturing definition of the list events if I'm assuming it's over and I get this also very beautiful that has no subs kiss I still have a quadratic or straight I'm still for a drink or minimization I still have some sort of like I find constraints in by that order last song for Honor system response that correspond to these so they sort of a nice translation between thinking about things in terms of states and input if you back and then thinking about the whole close up with France as a single a formulation of this kind of cute observation there is a corresponding so if I design a system using actor of optimal control problem I just showed you as long as it lies and that are fine space to find my indeed a controller realisation don't worry too much about the form I can use the system response to design a controller achieve that exact response in court because usually when I think about make a system to do it's about how I would like it to respond how I like it to reactions everything off that directly and as long as I can strainer in the right way that's really nice why would I do that I could just do normal control I'm interested in this personally I think the system also has applications things like this tribute what's on in my throat into this weird new optimal control control so sing you know I controller but I don't really know how the Dynamics progress have some R&B what has an estimated x knew that was going to happen when I put things and colours but no because I'm playing in something totally different than what's going to happen sorry Claire had a translate between these two things the really nice thing is that in system response based lifted from signals into Uno transfer function choirs in estimating dynamic space so he has rearrange this equation and taking me to things I'm looking for some response liars in the ABC has this we are looking response my sister presidents of the is like a condition for this to be true which is that so basically this invoice has to exist will guarantee that exist for any does Endor to be is to the constrained responses Norm to be less than and sorry this Absalon is the size I said suddenly I magically not going to act under these uncertainties which seems unrealistic because I knew the answer this is there an expression for have a true system will react to the services even though I designed and asked me that sit down of course this delta in this case is just this delta 8 Out of You I don't know what my areas in nvr I don't know my my asking me if I did then does give us something to work with right we can have it down the sky and think about how that uncertainty will affect Athens exactly what we do so family rate if we design the estimated space Aston Villa controller we get this sort of nice looking sister what is the Really Useful as a paradigm for analysing learning and control by for return family understanding housing disturbances the also the area estimation map for the closet behave Bristol in a stately backbiting eventually get back to perception begonia backed up if you back but most useful so far in the case of learning with CBB so we use this number to this we use it for a bus control film can have some Aptamil a controller is with respect others Essex to Bonnie and as we get my dear together we can sort of get these false complexity bangs how do I control Thunderbirds are go in the setting of a robust adaptive control services for over here in real-time trying to both estimate and at optimally in there some trade-off between sing a system by injecting and exploiting assistant by trying to resign turn this in the setting of learning while satisfying constraints so I don't know the system I need to explain it to learn something about it but I also don't want to violate some safety concerns we can also analyse today B motor Village play with me stroller reading about perception based we have a car we have some space that what we're trying to say is how can I make a scar scene 6 where just staying in the safe that is really asking can I insure my excess they safe despite view measurement errors I know that now get back to that output feedback looks very similar to state feedback we just have now so having two terms of four because two signals and then still stayed in inputs and we have the sort of same relationship between designing and affine space and then you're not going to go into the robust version of this for now because all I Really Want Is This transparent map to my perception I think we understand how propagate through to our seats and not give us hope for saying that those states will stay safe so sort of just by writing an expression that they had in the previous life thinking about our distance from training areas if we do if we close the loop with the controller from a system response then we can he is going to be the distance of our closest play in the training in the training data how much we plan to deviate from the training next return a particular part of that system responsible this is the system response that go to sleep radio Dan it seems like true on my definition right the size of the area x the map from here to stay over my plan David expression says is this true you are saying your kind this may be more appealing if you don't want to do linear control is that this is a condition that third with me reason about setting variance etc on my train an exploration to increase your support so the one Javier for that in the studying is that because we have this observation adjusting images observation return operation and we don't have labels we have labels and features are features here are the images or likeness a region of them the labels are the states and so that's a little bit too much before but I was assuming that we during training we have asleep when you can talk around online selling an exploration exploitation suddenly that assumptions seems a lot worse because if you really had it as a ratio then maybe you should just use African troll but it still does actually say something about how you should design your training data unsupervised method reception have access to images over time which is actually one of the director of the future work send this one exactly how you put Direct for a Sharpie edges of your safe to add more points to the to the six this kind of reasoning about what trajectories are going to happen to rent design trajectories and then just one example in case anybody really loves lqg or something and wants to understand play means in terms of that system lyrical and problem the optimal solution to that is a combination of static feedback on an estimated state estimation with like a static Observer so my S M dynamics play including update term based on the real why that I am sorry from the system easiest moon state controller we can actually like right out what is this what is a snapper on like saying exists that we need to control in Norma France where to stay for a hazardous form you can see it depends on sort of a + b case that sort of like the stability of the state feedback controller a minute I'll see you this stability of server this like BK charm what kind of the takeaway that point out k&l here there server trailer for it so how much you worth how much you your controller responses to ask me that stayed and l is how larger estimate the responses to the observed in this case if you are too small you might not be stabilizing your system enough and so these turn the diagonal can be big if it is like close to unstable and a this term and disturbed both had a CD in them so hard when you're also very sensitive so there is some sweet sweet spot in terms of being responsive enough to the system flexibility is the expression what planet in our responses but just to give you a bit more intuition from maybe what I'm saying when I talk about this everybody through everybody through robust control was the point so the point is that I can save this what are the functions of the last two limos closeness and closeness and personalisation play have this roof rebound so the sensitivity of the system to measure area is bounded by the slow of my perception errors are the clothes of the doctor is within the state safe players are bounded in a way that depends on the measurement sensitivity the plan deviation from the training data and the slip adversary about measurements turn off light all of these conditions are true even under adversarial girls but they require sort of the Assumption of a slope down that holds matter any like regardless of how you tried to be as arbitrary as possible with measurement error play satisfy server smoothness around training data then use play the fact that this is potentially even under adversarial as music is probably pretty conservative and that's like a thing in robust control that is constantly through and there's always a turn off and those definitely room to sort of bring a slightly more that is so prospective until like that I think you like a fire Bellamy just looking at the the guarantees of a theorem releasing I have this sort of limited measurement sensitivity set invariance around my trainer how long will it take away I think something even though I can specialise as a reference tracking give a lot more interesting for the things me and I can have a little bit faster display when I have plenty of time show videos if my reference tracking task is serve the difficulty of it is controlled by the distance between 2 waypoints and trying to track distance from where's abounded play this whole thing of last so what is a saying and the distance from my reference distance from my training data does about the quality of my perception the coverage of my training data for the more kind distance to be and the better my prescription map the smooth are sort of like more adapted to the setting the smallest Monaghan the adulterer are both letters about difficult the task so we sorted Russian something is about how training data and learning can limit your ability to achieve Lancaster Guardian what's the temperature that depend on your Design system respond how to make the term small but eventually they can't both Museum diesel thermostat line up infinitely make them small for the system itself is going to have someone only to save it retail question before I sort of said you know the system will be safe as long as that satisfies these condition that obviously Kabir a conservative this is just to say that there are some systems and some type of errors with actually not a conservative candidates of a different only if condition where I had this sort of particular position miscalibration in the perception map what can strain the controller December 1st I will be unstable rushing to work gacha simulator using Carla which is like an open source simulator where you can generate street views actually using anything to car Dynamix for this setting using this like hovercraft down next week which is a 2-l innovator assuming a perfect controller X and Y position and we're going till I get two different types of reception maths that just before but one is visual odometry where my perception maps and Beefeater as an image and then looks up images that match and then I do a special like Jamaica transformation the features in both images to try to figure out how far I am nearest neighbours + some geometry to give you something very good that works for the honourable training method for the simultaneous location location and mapping algorithm £200 the training 18 years Neighbours on 200 points with special jam Henry did like a very simple camera had will use and Max pool and we try and the song with it doesn't one more it also had no special or anything else our simulation results the goal here was this find something that might fail without special training and that sort of thing is her butters condition to with her fix that because you're trying to look for failure to understand odometry setting this is how far we are from I referenced Project mostly really well and the real evidence of William panaceas that our perception errors as a function of distance from the training data smaller very nice Easter bonnets if I really don't move to Heaven can you get this stay quite small properties to be clear like agro with experts anyone come from the same at maybe likes lying down to your good and bad but that didn't do enough to really say that we just got something not work very well if we just had his normal controllers that didn't account for potential sensitivities but it didn't work constrain the controller to act in a very smooth surface really large aliens in the distance from the reference to doctors play Example actually but a failure looks like four is the visual odometry so really in this case failure occurs because we fail to match so we sort of like failed to find the right features we felt a matching the database and then write like in this method we just like Drive forever into the distance and because it's simulator we drive through buildings sing some more have nothing on that work at it's not quite as possible because we just sort of houses black nothing that's telling us position be funny I have a lover time left so time left so then I will other words for even practice racing at arbitrary tracks in this case the first lap is a human demonstration of the Trap shape are pid control just reference following a round at first lap together more data and also during the first lap we serve do mapping and then during the second laps and all the preceding whilst we just double glazing turn the lamps and I think in this case is like maybe 30 of them we use it out of learning and he started you which was developed by some people that quickly and prosecco for what was the character of Drive faster after you swap by using data from previous what's special about this method for MPC is that the terminal cost ompc and mentioned before the receding Horizon strategy we have a final control problem finite-time control problem every time because it's fine either terminal password of matters a lot if I'm signing over a short Horizon the wall like in front of me but I'm only playing two steps if I don't her plane correctly cast matters alight ASDA's a thermal constraints and by updating that was data from previous Labs you can throw get really nice to Javier a car for example the answer cut corners and dry faster so this is a literation of the car the red of the planning Horizon and the green sort of this safe that were planning to reach the terminal set everything and I put it up because I'm going to show the video now demonstrate human the human is driving stick around the track free slowly because we're not very good driver play only there for us to see the hear from what the camera is observing the Rope is not a huge part kissing like the chair of the wall what were uniform localisation here this feature is this key points that are mapped again against some database first that is what is used throughout for the remaining this experiment rattling no longer updating database in practice we find that driving faster and update the database with the same time lead to failures in a weird way that thinking about understand you put imaginative thing where you learn add to your training data more that are we still doing going to drive much faster after about 20 laps so you can see here even our plan projector is there is much more space between these points were planning to dry my hair the dashboard camera it does look pretty like that you know it's crazy we actually have a lot of them are now with better tuning on the camera motion attack this key points of the we do have lapses in them as in with fast because of the fastening I don't want to talk about it just putting out a wrap up illustrate how we are not being limited by the perception that we have improve the control task because were difficult so MCC strategy is not a Waypoint tracking problem but it is for a bit now I guess to a Waypoint tracking problem we adaptively choose away please play resource you know the drawing with me like this story have a car with a fairly short playing Horizon they were trying to reach is very close to the car like an easy task car drove faster and get the permit to work in about the planet heart is much longer and run out planning to reach a so so much for that personality are trying to reach becomes much further becomes much further away delta example so how far away is the Waypoint it also moves away from the training data like the training data is just from the sunny one of the track moving away from that so for this reason we see that pushing more against effector system to be able to do so I have not yet fully close the gap between a demo and some the theoretical work around why it wouldn't work and I'm going sleep now but just to say b a r that nearest training data by leveraging control authority you can sort of size that issues of distribution really what this means another word of that green constructs and invariance at around training day designed closing system satisfy the stability proper does a liver and I think that you can take us work forward with one is an extension to receiving carer's in control or non-linear Peppa in the phrases that apply in the setting of the work to actually family that have not been done find unsupervised learning rate operate in the car in real time access to new labels of what say I'm at how do I actually getting better so the slam method the localisation method that I show actually is Sammy on supervisor you don't have to if you have a cancer formalizing and thinking about how you can use that adaptively would be really interest classy is a spider coupling between option and dynamics burning and four operation to forget even better better that I'll thank you and take any questions you just on the references I was wondering if you have dependency on something like how is it depends on how the series flow bindings for the sufficient and you need to characterize the cause of behaviour you're totally right someone of the future directions actually is that use a map a region you have some database eventually of frames with key points back at those points that you've mapped and say I like if I'm in any particular spot in the room will I see do I expect to see enough points to the match of the day today 14 one way to characterize that's Oban in the characters they said that would have only rely on the structure of that would include things like if the weight on one side of them is really bright and this is actually run into if we don't get the good having throughout night is there just as the RX but I can't keep up inside there are parts of the space where we don't have a good future we don't have it images and if you sort of look at them that can sorted by Samuel so it's always there and I cannot work to be done for play music you have to forget this case I'm really talking around 20 min and 9 very environment so like what you said is true get me nothing because it's one of these features in particular way that is more invariant highlighting changes as long as the camera exposure matches maybe would work and I think that stuff what are the past experiences framework so one apparently it's true I don't personally know people who invented by SLS as a way of looking at systems are at Celtic and I was looking for her and they told me that it all parcels for non-linear systems as well so that the expressions that I wrote about like some operators would apply for nonlinear operators but like you know the answer the answer is that like even though the expression might apply the county taster we're not a planet anymore so is not everything for your how this what the cells for synthesizing controllers for non-linear systems but I think you could use some exciting various ideas and I'm like really not in on then you can sort it all but I think that invented control barrier I think Aaron was here last week and then he tried to convince me that would help in this setting a new year will one of your photos anything around setting areas question your kids you have everything is not neither of them right to work on the car so that's fine for the work that doesn't like MPC like receding Horizon control and so we linearizing each of those receiving Horizons but the plan is to actually implement that sort of normativity constrained in a receding Horizon version of the SAS I'm hoping at that treated like over robot overly robust and like actually helping so that's something response play like cxy that like mirror minoris Estate map thank you can write equivalent expression like if you go relationship between system responses and controllers in a relationship between tourism Newlands connections that you can write an expression in terms of your perimeter that would apply play it is possibly fairly simple in this case that I'm not sure if it would like look nice 12:00
