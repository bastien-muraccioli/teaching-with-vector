in this talk I'm going to give you a brief overview what actually that have the talk will be based on what I did in my thesis and the high-level takeaways from that and then the second half of the talk is going to look at some preliminary work and have live inspires you and to do maybe some mechanical design in your robotics I'm so today I'm talking about hands in the real world in the lab you can select the objects are interacting with you can protect your robot and you can fix it when it's broken all those things are not true anymore when you're in and unstructured dexterous manipulation we need our hands to be resilient because there extended from our body is to hit the world write their job is to contact the world that you imagine they're going to be stressed very easily with lots of very high contact forces first I'm gonna start with a human have been inspired by the Human hands for in in this system we have a lot of moving parts we got input commands that result in some behaviours and motion are forces results in information Gathering so tactile sensing from our skin that combination of behaviour and 17 leads to have dick understanding of the are really important areas in robot design understanding of manipulation has always been in the system design how many fingers do you have to have a squishy skin what sort of sensors have you included and the system design question that will influence all of these areas of control and understanding play created the embodied dexterity group I'd like in Barry intelligence is served does the body have naturally and to be well matched with what you want to do manipulation that we can learn from looking at the human system is that under actuation might be a good way to go when we're designing hands that are able to do many different tasks a pretty famous study and there's been a new extensions of this works since then but what they did as they looked at the way that people use their hands the different sorts of the groups that they perform principal component analysis and looked at the first couple few principal components and found that they're really good at describing of vast majority at the grass that people use is that may be just as very small number of actuators a wide variety of grass device that has many many degrees of free useful Tor people have known this for a long time whether intuitively or explicitly this is a pattern from 1919 either in presenting this all your cos it's exactly a century ago and this is known as like the first handpan here's the profile and here's the top down view here the profile of one finger we've got three joints and we've got a single spring going through it and a single 10 tendon it curled up like Twitter Anthony Jones go1 abstraction where hire we've got four fingers and they are all being activated by a single 10 words between nimes with a slight pull the others Old Mill Fowey I think a pretty clever mechanism so people have been pretty good at thinking about this for a long time there are a lot of new and you're actually the chance and this is a slide courtesy of Mark is Laird describing Lady of underactuated hands that we extremely precise low degree of under actuation really really complied inflexible really good at can form into really add shapes this is still an active area of research because miniaturization we have access to new electronic have a century ago that's how we come up with new designs How We Do simulations we can now have numerical models for what's going on and when you come up with new perception and control strategies give new material come up with solo which is softer robotic Solutions come up with new actuator will it be is really I think summarise pretty well that the activities of resource that are still ongoing very much in French designs those designs probably intended for outside the lab they are largely being tested inside a laboratory environment what I'm really interested is what happens when we start to apply these in the field challenges that we need to overcome is really helpful because if you smash into something you will pass it with very quickly get out of the way essential so we start to see a lot of underactuated designs these are the ones that are 4 ocean Explorer this morning have a lot of specialism play the most recent one that's highly specialised it's a very soft newly finger design that grips onto jellyfish InDesign will only really work underwater because you have buoyancy the water your fingers also again you won't be able to actually grassbow much stuff telephone number I think there's a lot of really rich operation giant bees see that most of the grippers that are used in the field are these really simple rigid parallel grippers they are extremely reliable and they will break the world before they break them so really risk-averse applications desire 5 years 5 + year champ in the design of adaptive and soft adapted hands because people are challenging themselves to apply multi finger I take it inside the Lamb define is really clearly if you have a fully actually attend troll the degrees of freedom to either Harvester in motion or force underactuated design because the way they interact with the environment changes that behaviour things that you need to very carefully designed the past mekon to this like ballooning of many different Solutions start to think about what are under activated hand is going to be for a particular application very important elements is compliance use silicone rubber vs Steel compliance and here's an example of two identical hands tribution of the compliance in the joints of mixed up very different hands based on that one parameter conditions most people think of this as coefficient of friction that's actually kind of a poor predictor of contact conditions in some circumstances tell something that contact location where contact is likely to occur and that's also an important element of a contract condition we have an example we have a very slippery object and it gets pushed out of the head object and it remains in the hand so that's very important in summary were very sensitive to dissolve collect them in the design of a new hand to alter these conditions operation dramatically influence the behaviour I think that if you're able to let say switch a joint from stuff softest essentially have two very different hands and so being able to adjust these for an operation is a great underactuated typically are used for grasping and holding and rely on the arms to do most of them manipulate some people have a look at in 10-minutes elation like the devices for l much smaller set of the overall talking to these two sections enough complying elements into an directory Returns in particular for ocean exploration and for the design of wearables on the human head the design and control of contact conditions talk about the ocean one Project talk about two very new ways to go but I think I have some new interesting results ocean one Project Sally has given attack at some SO14 is the director of this project and I was lucky enough to be here when it was getting started and his vision is to have this very intuitive Avatar turn up on the ship can actually feel like they're in the environment touching and interacting with it even though it's it's that's why it has this like cool humanoid form I created this last with all section here find a right before I graduated we actually took the real back to the Mediterranean and take it down to a ship and we acquire Davis I knew that if his hands broke anything useful we can do any manipulation right so the hands and I was a central part of the design back here compliance and contact condition talk about Spring elements down here there's a single input shaft here fingers and each finger has breeds lights is very under actually then and we want this to be able to wrap around extruded objects so something long and thin like a tool or structure do that we also need to be able to perform too small or too large pressure rapper fingers around this is thinking about the compliance of the fingers so here the three fingers tendons in blue and when we pull and ears with finger work or Corolla we've decided to the compliance of the flexural joints very carefully what we did as we use this pretension spring you load and then as occurred mum and decreases and we get a nice d grass of spring way to get very stiff behaviour but make it so that is not too hard to close the hand what about though is these things down here transmission that shares loads between the fingers think about what happens if these good actually make them rigid have any idea with beds that's going to do to the under something is there a mean that all of the tendon in the same way a link constraint on all of the fingers can really soft infinitely sore spectrum and all of the tendon tensions have to be the same that say foreskin ugly in bye-bye changing a swan primary the stiffness of load-sharing a position constraint this to be that what does this mean for graphing are pulling it out of the that this is there's only one finger in the pull out next transmit open this finger we won't have to open all the fingers so what this be really hard to do see that in the Splat the stuff transmission and pink much better than the softest transmission in blue it is not exactly 3 times but you're getting approximately that order of scaling four is better in this case holding and Alicia structures and tools counterexamples now I like this one because it's I think pretty obvious so you've got this water goblet that has the stem the finger is too cruel and sort of inner luck with that geometry does the pull out forces in the structure yes we see that the start transmission in blue stiff transmission in ping as your your tendons are stiff doesn't actually mean that your hand is necessarily in its strongest play giving a very small set of objects deserve have the very soft the first transmission path please kisses you can see that the intermediate stiffness and green intermediate performance all of the time something I've proven with the friction and interesting things going on in the head this is an area for potential to see if this is true I'm over a larger set of assumption it's come up with a mechanism of the softest in the stuff is torsion Springs spring flexes it changes it's diameter hard stops or constraints to define under what load is going to be sore it's going to be and is open in there and we start to rotate the shaft to wind-up attends start soft you can still transition into stiff later if you have a hard stop on the inside if you didn't quite catch that you're interested the paper does talk about it doing this in a field I just I could sleep a little bit better at night knowing that we could choose to put this in a staff mode when we needed to does the softness of the tendon give you more strength in certain circumstances a string and You Shook it the worst case scenario for snapping A10 finger is coming into this box Max down onto onto the top of just going to make it more 4 that was one useful just to show that we were able to infect the pin the operator is it really necessary paying attention to this hasn't arrived so we want to be probably in the sophomore lifting a heavy object with one finger we want this one to be stuff collection of the ocean went contact condition object that we acquired from Bishop in this really feels by the way that these people are holding onto the kind of Cage in it from all different directions so this is really frictional we probably just hold it like this not doing this is a term for a geometrically constraining an object even if you have no friction for da bara sitting in water for a while it's really can do that without suction with this particular hand were not able to pick it spikes on it but now you what you can do is add a little bit of section 48 at the fingertip object is going to be attracted to that location and able to pick it up a really late and out of floor how much flora talking about so it's really gentle and so this is not a suction cup we don't have like a cup that actually creating a seal that's not necessary we're going to do because this is so light is rely on the strength of the hands and arms to do most of the manual tasks using the session flow to enhance that contact to make it a little bit easier one thing that's really nice about section is it a track subject to a very convenient location on the I'm getting to this expansion of what contact conditions me Christians have to do for contact even occurs where is that going to happen and instead of having to fit around for this the first take I just testing this neutrally buoyant obvious larger in more massive object when does this stop being helpful under what circumstances shouldn't we include structure I wanted to ask as what's the role of water drug on the usefulness of this life why is the surface this is actually a bioinspired mechanism call fish oh no the video they open their mouth they stuck in water and in with it comes to prayer an evolutionary trait you see very much on my own Square pasta and go but been underwater being in a denser and more viscous fluid at that starts to make this advantageous I want to go over it because it's a preliminary work and I don't want to steal my students panda we do have an ongoing green looking at fish as inspiration for grasshoppers and manipulators to this question of what about more massive objects what about water on far away from the centre of the palm we have no hope it's not going to happen we have her controller isn't last-minute disturbance that were not over able to overcome were still up for going to have a chance at Grass by this object this better we created a model what's our experimental data that that were using to validate the model are the models themselves this one here the solid blue line being underwater water jug on the album this red wine where we ignore what are drag on the arms this will be like grass been in space vs grasping in a still pool of water a little bit of water drag a little bit easier makes your grass breed and bigger the initial displacement of the army add suction increase of about 1/3 this again a little bit more forgiving rastrigin control it doesn't have to be quite as perfect and maybe we can go into slightly hotter environment and still grass stuff so we can now do some really interesting parametric studies parents for really time expensive I'm here we have varying the park hear this Blue Dot wine for the pump I showed you the experimental camp that we had is changing the tube mass so that we get the most benefit increase in the pump flow rate and pressure in this intermediate region object of 1 kg we benefit from increasing our section permit really really massive ABT no flow or does the little bit of clothes going to do the job interesting design experimental validation to a design question just refund reducing our contact or reducing our normal Force may be adding some lubrication balloon which we couldn't grass just by squeezing now able to start it push it up into the Hand and successfully grasp just because we had no have suction what else can we do with you measure the flow rate going through the two want and unclog as you make contact with an object and break contact with another that floor clogging when you also know do you know where that contact is occurring on your hand this is starting to sound like a tactile sensor something it's pretty much we all know physics pretty well so you can all the deuce that my thumb is in contact even if you can't see that touch sensing can be really hard water it can be murky their hands to be included as lotteries and why you would want tactile sensor this is located up against the surface time is estimating what the angle between the surface and the fingertip is time is a differential pressure cause that a difference of pressure transducer that's measuring head lice which gives us an estimate come to the surface we see this big drop in flow as we pull up we get these dynamic signals explain the stick slip events down and dance-off week and another very dynamic signal here the signal where you have server slow steady state signal when you also have the superimposed on Lethal Weapon local area is a really complex signal which is different from a lot of sensors that you usually would one in a great with a hat magic what we did as we started to try and validate whether this title centre would be helpful for grass did this last summer by the student who looked at if you could monitor flow rate to estimate the force of pulling the object out of him he came down he grasped the object and pulled out using machine learning to see if he could ask me pull out force with suction alone able to do ok for a first and definitely thinking that this will be in area for more research to come an accent especially in an underactuated hand is going to move defamation sensor is measuring a change in orientation between the finger and the arm summarises a little bit the second half of the time what is introducing new idea Dexter ongoing but are ready enough to to show our initial observation when is conditions for now handling coral reefs for handling pieces of coral so how does that change what we want to do at that contact Blunt spy that umbrella of compliance when designing people with spinal cord injury or just weakness of the hands so how do we choose compliance that is helpful for the person grasping the ocean one project that I show big platform you need a team you need a krill in order to deploy no if it's much smaller than the usual standard for something like in Barry so dark records is this huge machine you need an incredible amount of infrastructure enable very small vehicles one that I could lift up on my own that we can understand them better are smartphones control quite as large how to control when you have a very turbulent the Academy of science are trying to grasp this thing can we half an hour eventually we can a smash into a break a hole and then some away without the simple so just give me really frustrating two people doing the same task here we just want a little snippet so she's going to come in and and break up a little peace here we have just a little simple that's all that we may release too many of their biological test One strategy that people can take in order to stabilize their body is the hole onto the do this one the right they can sit down on the ground do that do you want to do blue Arrow V2 it comes in at grass onto the how much more precise the coral and then we can swim away with the same is a multifaceted problem so we're looking at the mechanical design of the grasshopper and the simple mechanism but there are people who are interested in the genetics so this is Cal Academy of science have also people who are looking at the vehicle Dynamics and control of this sort of platform when we were squirrels we start by looking at and so I do when I specify were looking at very deep core and because there's very little light they tend to grow in his very thin fragile please so we're assuming it's going to be this plate-like structure depends on to it it has his likeness features and they have a relatively regular size and shape find me the ladder stands when you're being on Tobago San drop spike feeders of hugs on to we are certainly not the first people to start looking at 5 head here and so here again lol squirrel inspired coffee and then we got spiny by here it's on microphones have been around for a long time but recent work has found that when you get really good at engaging with a surface with spines is actually the material breaking off when your handling course that's going to be a failure mode so how do you get around free now the surface really well awkward that surface you don't want to be too sure play induce early fracture is very simple 3D printed rotational cleaner post pension a walk with the surf rip onto it centring and then as we swim forward or spines open up in Inner lock with the surface so I thought of latching and this one directional once we pull backwards when I can come off the choice to use rotational spiders that have some consequences the reason why we wanted to go at whenever there's a Valley when we have a spine that's really well it goes with the search misconstrue assume that it can rotate freely when have this relationship between the angle of your spine the spikelets down in the belly is going to squeeze harder this interesting singularity and so if your angle becomes too steep you now or pushing so hard that you pray ijaazat plastic is very compliant play all of these challenges in the fact that this is very preliminary for able to hold onto real Mesut buttercross 60 newtons of force cheap $10 design a failure modes are usually sharing off the surface feature what happens once we have equal tissue there turn also when the spine placed on the field to field experiments when was with a handheld device and diverse didn't testing we are blue Rav that went down to the Caribbean and then this upcoming mods were going to Maria and there's a Berkeley field station in French Polynesia and at that point were hoping to have our breaking assembly mechanism ready hopefully we have a fully integrated the biologist are very concerned about when your handling is very fragile ecosystems are you doing damage and so we're going to work with them to understand implications long-term of us actually handling is Reeves the very final Project designed to help people with spinal cord injury look at features of compliance and how is divided into this machine innovation is that there are a lot of people with spinal cord in show me the United States alone people who have touched your pleasure which is some degree this in the hands and arms survey them they say that regaining some function of the hands and arms is one of their top priorities as I say you're an area and bowel function right so this is a very basic the number of Gloucester urban design and you can see they're like 2017-2018 and I believe that all of them have at least stated that spinal cord injury injury could be one potential application some interesting linkages and interesting actuators is Amer context of commercially available hand orthotics 45% of people with spinal cord injuries say they basically never use their device and what people mean we came up a shade of Spring steel that goes across the dorsal part of the hands of the the stuff factory here support the support is this person right here press the button part of the fingers Spice design this a palm Grove was supports the thumb and also protects and adds friction to the Palm here what device can be put on top of this and this is a very very common device that people use can we test this on a small number of healthy individuals asking them not to flex their hands just an average of up to an average of 20 newtons of force does a pretty strong grip how do we distribute compliance on this device play me one of these to be extremely simple very quickly that a cantilever beam that's been activated by the tip is going to bend the most at the base we need to add an extra joint here in order to increase the curling of the fingers we did find that this placement along the finger so when you had a new subject put on the club they serve naturally fitted to themselves in a work pretty well so it was relatively agnostic to individual variations in finger length or hand size one of the really important element of this is done ability you look back and what does what does a new devices that have been devel the awesome new actuator and they are really great as research devices but how is a person with a limp and with a paralysed hand supposed to put on I stiffen my fingers and I grab onto it with my other hand like this so how are you supposed to do that without a sister device we really focused on having this Open surface on the base or somebody could easily and put it on and then it's pretty much in place except for maybe two straps that you could do with your teeth really important we haven't characterized on ability yet for this device and in fact that's not a stupid well-defined premiere turn of course how do we control us we have a motor that opening and closing the hands how does the operator tell the device when it wants to open and close this behaviour called Tina disgusting to do with the fact that the tendons but that open and close your finger asterisk how long is it across your wrist naturally Close China sensitive down your wrist don't like this Alexa wrist app put more effort to do the what are your fingers called is new to spinal cord injury if they just had one this is an approach that actually type as a strategy a compensatory strategy in order the grass very small object you now couple in wrist motion to finger motion are the constraint a motion constraint at your end of factor that can influence the restaurant I have actually moved my whole back stop you decided again this is a hypothesis spinal cord injury with fine as an intuitive way to open and close the device we know there's something that we need to tell what will see whether that's 289 and but when we asked people who are healthy who don't have spinal cord injury to do this you can see their lower clumsy what's next we just got our first IRB approved texting work with individuals with spinal cord injury really excited for that cause I think we can it's just going to be a tremendous opportunity and so we've got a lot of studies planned for that this is so I showed you this study before the principal component analysis most of these studies that are characterized in human grasping subject for they don't necessarily work with people who have alternative ways of doing that reticulation this is going to be re characterizing what is disturbing in four different individuals and I also teach an augmenting human dexterity course and which I went viral this work was actually done by all people not in my lamb eyebrows students from a different lad from professor Thomas Lucas lab and the MSc lamb and then you can look lights this summarises I've been a part of play show juice what is lead to when they're still a couple of questions there and then some new areas of research they think I've just a lot of potential for growth takeaway is that when you're designing mechanisms for the real world have to consider compliance machine because of my calibre make appointment scenes not break and still be very useful conditions can make all the difference stuff to come in the pipeline the work of the spine Gruber was Monica and Michael Abbott hope that with the suction tactile sensing but they're also doing other first year students who have another halfway if I gave ataxia in another year will be a whole set of new projects to prison it's really exciting time in in Edge any questions work it's actually class work students for designing prosthetic who was born without the distal part of his at his arm after the hour for a bill for him I'm just not the suction sensing the operation was the operation and be part of this is haptic feedback thank you will be possible to get any sort of Patrick back on Snapchat cab that like contactor birthday I guess that might have way to sense engagement that would be kind of cool what's that up to try but like I'm saying so if you're able to correlate your sensor information with some other information at Telford used at external Force and put that back desperation when they would be returned had the rest really that's that it was more proof-of-concept but allow robots to have loads of play what you instead use of force met before internal forces some other sort of interaction that you can measure with your eyelids off well suction cups on the person and see how I'm sure there are section style Haptic displays out there I just don't know them regards to the suction like that are you imagine ok you're going to get the most Force when you're close circumstances going to be acting like a star you just tryna like grip onto I like Tom and object your best case scenario will be a 40 or so if you have that fantastic and then we can do that I would say it's a little bit less sensitive to cruises on the surface so the recycle slightly porous object cat won't be able to see still be able to pull a pressure differential the fact that it's a Flo the gate the section cut element dumbest expands it into a Newbridge NN the censor have a soft skin any little misalignment is going to create a really large flow if you create a really soft skin there going to be able to Halfway club your orifice over a much larger range of contact I meant for can you just miss contact altogether considerations in seawater do you have trouble housing Motors in a containment wear play soft actually but maybe they don't like hold up well in the water people who have tried explaining different sorts of activated underwater so like alloy for example I think it was used in a low fishrot by but the problem is bubbling in where things happened been exposed to water will change is your conductive properties a lot of elements and then even in the ocean when you go deep your pressure usually when you see me for about something that's in sensitive to pressure so you've got incompressible materials or some sort of mechanism cannon Steel is Israel a common discuss the materials can crude ocean when it's an oil filled cavity because if you had Eric might like oil and actually some Brussels matters if you treat the materials right can just running water again you have that one term ageing effect that might be an issue put the alarm underwater dresses that has to do with like having a slimy tissue there really different don't like dry what are the Coral might just be more brittle when it's been dried out exactly how the correlates of changes underway that's going to be the biggest change find behaviour it is pretty much static I don't think I should change too much so I guess to me with cause I need the contacts and stuff capital strategies which could take so if able to reverse flow if I'm measuring fluoride and we detect the clock that we know isn't contact we could reverse the flow and and sometimes all like that I could work and this is where I think the scaling is not advantageous for for this amount of flow excavating shipwrecks what they do as they essentially and pump water Through a Tube negative suction Force this way and so I'll why your pump is up here so group goes at the numbers play draughts strategy things people do like kind of his big chamber is where your good walk and settle and your promise of tabs strategies that you could go about making sure that become a problem important practical detail going back to the corner is it just rigidly attached to the Liver anything that you because it's hard to control something is going to be forever controller that are over because we now have the same one as our sort of sharing code and hardware to me like in in the vertical displacement are going to be able to get within a small number of centimetres actually with visual feedback because you're close to a substrates you can get very good at detection of motion with a camera going to be OK without adding more degrees of freedom and armour something but there has been working nights space group and stuff like a flexible wrist or some sort of atom transmission can be really helpful and I do think eventually what we could have is like thank you in a very robust and I'm still let your robot can I swim around as it may in some way but as of now work I just waiting to see what it's going to be the need
