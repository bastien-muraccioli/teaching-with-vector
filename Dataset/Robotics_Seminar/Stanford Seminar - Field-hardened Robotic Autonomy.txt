Direction very nice to meet you day about going work on what we like to call Phil Harding Everton results in the field but primary I want to relate how field robotics kindly to investigate from them a lot about what we call resilient and I like to think of the systems in the council and make a simple demo in the lab and I not sold I have some bite her now but it's not that many this morning were being deployed in the fee what allows robotic system to Brazil for example us analysis that you or situation that you have to deal with it's the fact that you have you have a dormancy and you have yourself if you can do it in the way that you think you will have to do it you will find another way that for someone if you work around the rain and thunder in the same fashion for a body systems what can make them essentially resilient in their opening surprise new accidents here I want to mention I'm sure you'll study lot of technical stuff and engineering and other fields of science but I I want for myself my motivation for a body started already from before the guy that tried to present a good future for their and in preparation for robotics in a sad so I always put up the mess lights it's kind of motivation I will discuss three topics the case of robotic systems that operate autonomously in conditions of Central station and I will explain in very large scale deployments so if the claim is that the limit is the battery I supposed to build stuff for the sensors I will assume and I will We Will impose it in the Felix payments that is 020 communications to the this means that there is no way to recover with her student if he's around so we will just deployed and then hopefully things work otherwise we actually had a crash I'm going to present today summer hits in the darkness subterranean challenge but not is Italian organised about robots it is over 3 years the first year two place and finalize the competition last what was called that floating in mine like and unlike in subway infrastructure over summer we have to go to a cave with Anna which came but the cable network and then in the third year there's a lot competition which is supposedly the oldest contact with 3 hours of Endurance and 0 again right after 5 m in the introduction to the competition stage we have no ability to communicate remotely situations and practicing what can make a robot autonomous in such condition think I'm sure you know the Glasgow block diagram of a working with controls say destination path plan against this different levels of functionality also interplay in the typical example is a parable that is kylian something more safely in Leicester Mr Kelly compared to robot that is very certain about this post and the map of them I can fly with extreme stepping for my robot that can afford a collision with a wall again you can fly much more with agility and much more aggressive how to fly in a very conservative money so we want to think the design of the robotic slips and systems in a comprehensive manner and accounting for then the connection between the what do we call a resilient system in this process I will send all some selected results and the results of the last 3 years of research so the first thing that I will mention is what we call sense integrated multimodal localisation and map this conditions is the appear simultaneously for example in Underground night it's pretty common now in the body search it is dark that still easy to dissolve in Hurghada for example is unaffected or with lights on morning such as smoke or dust and guess you drive and you know that difficult to drive through fog light against the grade 34 cameras get it through so it's also difficult with smoke and with us medically self-similar essentially not possible to estimate the robots pose or nap of environment S-Class look identical navigate to the super straight long pants very narrow and very large scale and the question is how can you make a robot that is robots in terms of visualisation for exam idea the we want to present is 24 how you produce multimodality in the sense of identifying what are the models that enter combination can penetrate all such second one is called the fuse modalities tied together aspect introduce in without to exploit as much as possible television and the main reason is because longwave I are able to penetrate most of the common experience that you will have to fill in an accident super dusty Underground line is there very common and especially if you have your letters of your helicopter pushing all the dust vision is one key way to go and overcome the situation but the problem is that traditional visualisation will not be reversed the applicable to thermal Vision actually star the last 2 years working a lot in this environment is there an underground mine my feelings have been miserable in order to exploit in preparation for this year's can see there is the flying through a cloud of I don't get the point this over oven inspiration it's possible for vision means that you have a collie degraded friend because it's full of that which is essential travel and then you can see that in the figure that I can emphasize this television is completely unaffected the problem however is that here you don't sell it a very strong environment of his official Television Centre Fluval camera Bush provide you a full 16 by 12-ft in Action by 16 resolution about the garden which means that if you replace your organs from the resolution of Emma dragons inside and you ready for the temperature is modulus the same as it is in an environment that is 12 ground in Boston between Muslim different round rock water and some support my CVs diff how to fuse them work that one of my students published last is the word we call Kitty Aoki frame based on initial odometry it's a bifurcated structure that on the front the most significant dragons in the full result number one number two different to do a line from the current frame to produce a key things that have been incorporated in Sliding window keyframe do some refinement it does get love interest from the current frame to the river sea frames in improving the destination of their respective transformation and then we will do optimisation or the back and accounting courses for I'm us so the founding is responsible for this typical image alignment and cancel ization and also Lana cancel ization from free play fact or similar vision is also that you have a process called flat sensor accumulate a lot of noise this actually happens but it's very insignificant I can lift making noise block it for roughly as it puts a black body in front re-calibrate the noise data and then re-enable back to you which means practically for a vortex that for you operating is conditions any care for example camera filter will not really doing amazing different organisation that uses my number of friends in it back nationalisation of the keyframes you have to drop your frame and then does optimisation of the imu switching from the car places to get it for you to have an understanding automatic error that relates the dragons that you have in the time of overall scale space is traditional in computer vision we start from the most Spotify level scale space in to go fast and then we've refiner's station on the back-end with depend essential information that scale and wait the problem between the army prediction errors from in a camera 30fps use but the one we and we're on it actually in the same speed on the road this is good yet this is underground mine in Nottingham ablebox are not they don't wait to experiment with the robots and we're line or robusta common frame there for that competition here is the result of kei automatic estimation in comparison in mapping in environment because of this beginning with another or we could facilitate something like ground truth in this relates to new features with features and interviews the green ones blue ones that track from before and red wine Direct and then you say of course the proper alignment between the frame and the car in frame so they will continue I will only play for a living the resulting fact is that with a very light with sensor with a sensor of that does insoles for 4th disclaimer here if it is a Portsmouth from Anarchy fire actually this Saturday coming other Solutions Derek Marchmont the ability to estimate the rate of the Dollar Tree underground mine in even when for example the geometry is so similar so when Eliza will not work now are you still a lot of cases number one but at the same time you'll pay huge penalty of weight even the most like that is roughly number one number two it's filter not work in the self-similar dramatic situation so we need to add this who was the model in fashion subsequently in a cascade and then we have come and work on a common postgraphile station between the different modalities all together in one single optimizer where are solution with state-of-the-art navigation to use turn on data with 16-bit for audio and the letter to from office we don't want that we are better in terms of Visual localisation what windek is that Taylor to sterling localisation and their methods there the other ones don't feel because they're bad they failed account for the fact that thermal data information much more expensive compared to just this on the right in the case of environment that's actually one of them early pictures navigate Walsall environmental again go dark in Colchester possible so we have the classical expectation of less than 1% is it is typical invision naturalisation no which is an effect again from many cases of Visual the think of the following evil cover robot that can penetrate conditions of Visual data tomorrow compared to a traditional system that will marry Linda Gray David Cameron name you or a ladder which will then be subject to all the problems I collide in the question is what can you do with it in terms of 30th animals exploration of large-scale and postman genetically constraining invalid problem we can be working last year's also what is the difficulties difficulties that you have trained make a very large map of Edinburgh information of building them up in an online process but then if I want to go now play the we don't know the Muppet this information for the environment than the general bounce like the Builder Exeter why does it very narrow which means that you cannot simply go fast if it was no panic space the solution stay the same but we just go faster therefore we have to avoid every obstacle which version situation dental protection it is not unlikely and we'll have to come for the fact that are Robert Maltby and certain intensity estimation process try to think of this problems all together in one picture three different types of algorithms that we don't combine into a more comprehensive system of systems accounting for the rubble and certainty the underlying and 70 of the State estimation an obvious example that you have the thing is if you're on in Birmingham on the left side is it is a white wall in the right side is official football you yourself will look closer right side understand what you are right it's always look similar and visually identical there is no point if not help you to remember where you provision to support Islam support organisation the thing is also similar in something is very distinct it makes sense for that what is one more data from the moment they better be spend on areas provisionally salonwear attention of the rabbit make sense latter two are essential in local behaviours the questions how can we make it behaviour that allows the rabbit to sample and navigate very logical and explore them and especially branches for example and Underground really on the on the ladder on the what's a mention couple of things but later about some more recent results for collection aware exploration and some learning-based methods to compress the behavior you know the food problem accounting for your estimation properties and Sons for is it going to be this means that very complex this means that the practical solution to the full configuration in here we propose a motive jacket next to my station scheme that on the 1st what in the whatever no space has explored so far a set of rubber configurations apart close down space the pinkola you say that nice to go there once the device is the best past explore than own space given a certain think of you of essential how should move towards these people in Inner City the respective associated localisation and 17th is minimise as about navigate in the respective the second level cache Robert post entrance some of the landmarks of the environment if we refer to a visual which we do so by factorise in the covariance into diplomatic and idea that comes from the fury fight tonight play sample possible that go to viewpoint and find the one that minimise the arrive roughly a video of how this the first paper of my lap here in the US Louis Vuitton environment as you can sing selection of configuration and the small blue bubbles that you see are the locations of expected landmarks from Vision is there any flight to walk forward but instead of going straight you see the repositions is orientations be worth it once more straight explore forward observing as it moves good features that has identified before mean things that they associate and 70 is not exploding now it is important to highlight that this is not a global solution so we can provide a global because we don't actually know them solving only a part of the full problem actions that the football people that will help but without the first update in real-time fashion slow down now again even this component we can say that we can plant pots that are aware of the respective and 70 of the robot that we can explore and try at least meantime basic consistency of our posts and most liking at the map is also Falcon something that we are now at every level or 4 basic Salou little Park to be running in all day other steps I'm going highlight we're trying to work in this very large scale of environments around 9 if you've never been to a factory underground is impressive watch monthly bills sometimes too you know for production in make money underground can be multiple mines lever traction engine x exploring underground set in Leicester scenario Google come from the end of the environment to exploit in identify who they have to say is really simple because we are so capable and so Amanda letra overcome different environmental conditions and understand how to navigate supercomplex and not the case ability to certain extent of course into the water system we propose a two-layer structure at bifurcation between superfast efficient local layer that only has to deal with what sugar do if it didn't before expiration can continue shouldn't go to previous branch and from there continue expiration this is an underground line about this is actually a mind that we deploy mine in Korean from the beginning the portal and it's somewhere in it we can sample subspace off inverter only part the one that's behind us and we haven't explored the area in front of us after Forza this isn't that we use in Islam mystical incorporate a lighter so they're fairly long range box that you seen this local configuration space we can sample some way of identifying the possible Paths of the rabbit letter for the purpose of discussion this a graph-based otherwise I'm going to a graph of possible configurations this means that inside those you can identify the possible topologies to navigation how can I navigate in this explore space every note of this graphic is an updated with associated expected exploration game you can actually sorry you can actually thing we can you find the part that most of their loans navigate an Explorer s Masters winner evidence that is Alex Albon why because it's never really knew the whole map navigate to drift in their some branches for the right it is possible and most likely will continue straight because it gives engaged and eventually the mask it's memory not just the full map which ends up being extremely last meal before planning in the full map will become impossible if it was my long and you need a different Direction this is not something you want to do to start something random me in the fool navigate identify the locations of the graph that correspond to Francis and other open expanding space write down a Sparks card navigate to previous locations plus to home back to the initial position then we can identify this brand reposition itself continue decoration space is remaining endurance on the sea when then Doris about when trigger another operation in return back to come this is the type of Mission you would consider for 3 you don't have communication it comes back if give you the date inspiring to sing The Troubles can do all the mission without the single let me show you this is a deployment settling in the body work together with our legs from 80s so you see this the local draught with some of the graphene at the moment the green one is up to my it keeps running the moment now this particular window relates to an area of the mind and the guns and underground mine go backwards we play the video to fast go backwards it will keep it for y9u drift of the mine because we're together with the animal like the system from ethi supporting the Rebels will go above animal to fly slip One Stop for the about to do the process this point the battery is going down in the calling automatically tweet my location and this is the resulting from the from the actually take the lessons learnt from this process and the key fact that we observe in doing this operation what muscle matters replying systems especially if it won't go into large-scale environment number one it's extremely difficult in this Super Mario set all postman collections and let's you fly super information before the fact that you need to go cheapest still expensive download right to say bifurcation of local and global planning it is still full expense for the rubbish this means we spent a good 300-400 10 m what's the letter which Santa ok is there was with with low-speed you want to get super fast and also the effect of possible correlation in kinetic energy from Mayo may not to sing it from pump if you're going to touch the wall across them all if you want we tried to compress the behaviour of our planet learning framework which is learning framework for S police highlights Mr Robot that is collection it also is more like that's my place Vauxhall service station what will start going in science underground mine and explore with a speed that was not coming out from the planet which was very far from what I thought that was a collision tolerance speed this means that even if we We Can Survive which is not very kind at the moment now have a little bit so this was 1.85 m per second average speed in our goal eventually in such underground mines to go with Apple phone meaning of song for you but actually does significant difference compared to what has been we will explore this mine is kind of the Strait group so it's not exciting results from an abandoned mine this is a complete with twins if you tried to get your rabbit into an abandoned place with yourself actually going to ensure about and was a very narrow place because that's how mines were faster eliminate the need for it larger itself in order to avoid collision considered the exact time and you will see to explore this underground mine and you will see to make a small collision with the moment which is nothing special but the fact is that was actually unintended that wasn't even plan from there from the planner to international polite that was just happened because it was so small their son of course even for myself right from the Dublin city generate that was one of the colours turn office containers expiration which here is that this common thinking between perception planning controls that runs an embassy and eventually of course proper design about a compression the behaviour and the previous approach was still notice of you hundreds of MS what you see here is in the action in the order of 20 Ms all together and this is a full length sliding window of point clouds from their necks taking the pass score in the boss of deck with the previous one it was for training this solution and then providing identical more less parts such as those of the expert in the in the online operation and again that is completely naturalisation I want to do learning keyboard we actually can compress model-based behaviour into much more efficient framework that we can then deploy in in prison inmates release systems with fairly good robot photograph investigate but impressed with the best garage to compress knowing good behave songs about extremely fast to operate online and they actually lying much more minimalistic data supports full we know only utilise a small window of observations as there that's what I would like to just find out here is that you see the rubbish from my from 88 utilising the simpler the same underground mine that I show it is salt initially The Wanted from I will explore of course bell underlying locomotion is Kendal from the controller of the rabbit supposed to the high-level planet working in these things actually from the lower control is a multi-level system so I don't call a second component that relates to expiration again the whole ideas can you make it through them systems and resilience to reception and how do I get some credit for some work that how far is €13 in Mustafa filter results but it's actually what we tried to do utilising this collision current by Design Robert we have to work on on collection even before myself at the vhi walk-in Edelman collection or inspection for contact this was an academy and he was so we didn't want to do something practical and useful as we want him to take care try to touch environment and instead of we want him to do walk around the lake walk Lake just show the possible in from that essentially in the best I can do in history but feeling right so that's that's the most important Bishop nmcc approaching weekend that's the position running underwater to say that you know what if you give me part of the world that is super smooth I may well as well slide on it because it's not going to be too much in the world ok to anything give me a non-smart can use this kind of like a flying cartwheel mode in April contact common in working from us before utilising is really not the most dynamic performance of the world I have to say it's a week robots the classical German trees it doesn't job and it's only cancer shows has not the central whatever just use the sound I want to make sure that we maintain invent here from the moschino that is not actually possible to keep flying and he will start a very slow process of doing this kind of flying cartwheels I'm saying it's not something that you want to do it something that you have to do for a light mission many thanks we do stuff just because we want to investigate a problem so this is one of these categories are supposed to take this is not investigating what is possible you don't want to do this fight but it's possible to display in the same people actually this is this idea of incorporating collection later allowed us to proper collaborations to utilise the system here in California in mine called Black Diamond exploiting the fact that cancollide we are super excited at the moment exploring the underground environment high-speed compare previous videos going back to the last aspect the controller reception planning and I will Andrews some ideas about control and how can this relate to a villain basically of resilience and it doesn't seem a mean that you have more than 1 systems to the multiple approaches on motor robot systems that exist in the world and there's one in a team of 5 something the classical approach we have a link system this means that the electromechanical link from one rubber together but which also means that communication within one row to the other of which Weather Banbury one that weekend because we have a feed off their joint also is and coders in theory of this destination from one robot and keeps making his face from another about the front or the back or both the chain that has been worked at least they're one of the first I thought Direction they say some good work for a robot we follow similar Concepts in different ways of controlling the different goals so I'll go here was to make a configuration that can do things can minimise the cross section of a big system so clever collection system system system but the cross-section can be still a small as we want the size of a small supposed to maximise coverage or another Me by redistributing what are the controller Robert in a meaningful manner when you control my controller on board this scandal from many rubles in USD 1 Robert transposition of the full robotic system actually organised on the link level the connecting link between the linked roller first left hand control but the actual rope is your of my rabbit remains fully control this is not but actually telling the people operation it will change to go through different settings tomorrow or the opening it might as well just change your me to what the remainder things that you can do with the first ones you have very good woman applying about my rolling about this for the system you're right Heroes one of the other woman if you want to use for example for purpose of manipulation a piece of work that the student is trying to do this point of course you can fly transfer that old school clothes that we used to do when we're doing controls in Alfreton repair tool on yourself by Philip point keeping the centroid of the horror with that one exact point right and then just gone up or down so I suppose that they call Robert go around hitting can make Alex and it'll it'll come in Android office States at exact spot then he's that we want to open evolve on the ground so then we can action rotate without moving the centre here we have that we go up and bayesian all together to you is that if you properly research for example international research and exploration research 17 exploration or motability control and insurance before if you work an individual level who is research essential design every loop in a manner of accounts for the limitations in Torbay example of perception is going wrong as factorise from the Guardians planet coaster bit more conservative Than This Means orchestral look forward percentages this means that you make an increasingly more robust and resilient autonomous the basic idea from now I'm just going to show some application some paperwork with mine I went in I can take the United actually that again here in the and some collect from Cannon and it's about radiation outside project in the United States and storing all insane nuclear waste everywhere in the country and especially in the east not in there storing very clear and eventually especially now is there many many years is Andrea than defy what is the situations we should before but in fact or sink allow it doesn't count radiation Maplin environmental environment radiation field and when we use for the purpose of estimation is in Michael Franklin estimate the intensity the Guardian of the field test presents the Dragon on multiple points if you destination for the field so it can know which parts of the field are those that are identify Dennis may be properly and from that by understanding we don't know well we know where to go herein Dutch buckets that's What She Does Is there and the rubber just goes and explore Maps Sheffield and Barnsley information and sitting here we have actually with that the radiation field estimation forgive us about the factors that we will take something that looks impressive but then the 3D estimation is is actually an updated with expected all the environment is fairly hot because I don't have the measurement before that because any of these points actually secretly and no interview today like what should we go to explore now that you know plastic forward it will go towards the other set of packets and eventually a decent estimate lying radiation filter current edition of the property later for Grantham very accurate paper about how I can comfortably on sorting office for the work of my lap hear the last 3.5 years that we have been working in the United States I will of course credit our sponsors and afterwards we had worked with mining companies we first and safe and and other agencies funded our work it work with NASA without word more in that direction not giving space to book it off for my personal goal is to put at least one line of code in space and of course finish work that like in European projects has no direct a very bubbly want to credit collaborators eventually and the cool part is that you together called in any search from idiot from seeing you operational company Berkeley Minnesota flyability help us into executing this particular work very importantly I want to credit of course my car breakers in my lab postcode that both actually professional engineer within the work on termination where are Frank Warner Russell Nicola now in the p02fa this light and others working in the lab and my face is like this I want to indicate why this is such an exciting experience this is all from Phil best they'll and write up in the bottom right is from the other ones in the contest in Switzerland when you see them there anything fun what's 50 I wasn't there just office light of previous work wondered when I was very kind to mention that's not personal work after 14 p.m. in the main please please call Philip Wallace Langham scheduled now he works in Switzerland fixed-wing aircraft 5.6 in wingspan 6.5 kg I was able to demonstrate what is called professional flight and there was a new charger in the day you keep flying across the night and the morning you can start charging your battery and your remaining battery enough to get you through the day and then this can happen again and again and again 81.5 hours of continuous for any aircraft below 50 kg if you know the other stuff this is the one before this particular diamond very similar to the one you have very good shopping in robotic estimation that was 81.5 hours of this metal working properly controls a lot of work on Horizon in proper engineering I'm sure you know PS4 pixel permitted development I compared to the main stack you can take online it has some decent sensing not too much because there is not much if you want to do that the world record impressive enough when we start the calculations will do that thing to when cancelling morning to do the progress in solar power has anybody supposed we're leaving early better than our calculations online about how we can design such a system so if you want to play around you can actually enjoy the possible different designs this is the ideal design stop the 5.6 easily but make it a little bit wider you can have even better intolerant that's pretty old work with myself and and and student put together pushing objects for some crazy the name of the lab and you can actually see something that is very recent work that I'm completely unrelated but it's pretty impressive for me to eat that they actually use it up now to pay it won't be sprayed by actually very close already from back in contact and in flight in the control accounts for transition MPC design someone mentioned much because I'm sure you have seen impressive videos with rubbish play so we can there's nothing on MPC essentials very important for a vulpix would like to open source a lot of what we do that is what we have very useful for the community in what you have time of course to open source because open we have planners motherease controller and in other things that you may want to use in your teeth close my talk I want mine and Vision release what we call resilience and I think this is a key for making logos that are two useful in a variety of conditions to go away from Tesco emotional as a robotic system or about the system of systems Which also means that they can be used in applications either construction inspection to get it completed or signed by sorry the possible applications of interest in to this underground environment for just room for space exploration is a lot of room for doing very important meeting start a nuclear decommissioning and of course you can take the same technology and extended and improved into further types of applications internet if you are students I want I like that you know nothing was that will be possible if we weren't vacation vacation I didn't understand the mission before becoming professional but I can now I fully understand why this so essential so again the big guys that do courses science and on applied topics such as robotics and very importantly in I don't know if an undergraduate we try to emphasize on starting their research as soon as possible in the course of we will soon be yesterday test go up the stairs design from Madagascar dancing without putting essential giving giving something that we don't believe it's possible but if they feel that is not possible then they don't feel they have to deliver then they can think it more fundamentally and try to come up something with we thought that I want to close my account to thank you for being here and again I hope you get the message about our research and resilient economy I'll be very happy to answer any questions question thank you is there a today in euro stop that me that super exciting and people such as working Activision that especially event-driven camera we have a lot of work because we you self isolate polarization in a lot of progress and sensing that allows you to get for licences that are very dry can use infrasound to penetrate condition suffix even more specific and more yes there are many public can potentially influence horrible people work in the future and of course there's a lot of effort I think and very attentive macanese very early in the stage of rubbish everything how to take all the information and use it at once to make them up for it eventually you'll get the computation are you going with a lot of data and you can do it very low level on the camera or the sensor that selects what is the most we can get a super competency map in scooter small environment resolution navigate navigate 20km I don't want to remember 20 km of xyz points I was just wondering about the approach did you try on and haul training one someone mine and then we used in another mind we had very specifically we put from now on simulated environment with Wednesday that I supposed to a camera is the ability to use similar data is actually fairly straightforward you can simulate the geometry and I'm just talking to use noise when you're there asthma difficult to go from simulation to video we just made a lot of mine and we actually used or separate departments of hours to have messages insulation in tallaght phone number to we took some up this open my download files online and put them in and then what we use is our planet to use this point cloud organized on a 2 seconds of data over 2 s 25 that large should go in we also operate something specific to the mines to find where to go in full 368000 Direction which direction use England's generally safer to use data to your network used cameras well it's if you see what people would if it's possible people try to do cabin with small fence why should we put anything else on the other car I don't want this baby till later in all around for some reason the question is if you need a lighter in your application for other purposes such as for example you want a good team up then you're going then yeah I think 4 in terms of trade it's much more into simulator vs and action cam data is simply right it's just the range call relations using camera with really we use densified with who despite with vision request to make the pose even with just pure Vision and we will use them a we don't work so much on on local.ch number one number two we don't really watch so much and 25 navigation problem that variable using the other to reduce price to what we can do an fpga now there are 7 things that apart from the things that can happen nicely I speak for example is a good thing I can have in Iceland on fpga because something's don't really work very well that it was on the back of the soft core armoured land around their own nipples so we die also with hardware I think eventually because putting with hardware or special hardware for the case is one thing that you can do I think they realise how can we reproduction and that's why we're tighter than D5 what album should we be from the design for the project if you working speaker
