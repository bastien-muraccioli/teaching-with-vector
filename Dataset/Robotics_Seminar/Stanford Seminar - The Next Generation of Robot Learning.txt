I want to start with a story actually so interested and how robots manipulate this case was the robot wanted to figure out how to insert that roadblock into the ships running q net worth of maps from images from pixels and taken from the Robots talk to pilot the Robots what to do if do child is able to start from scratch without having any knowledge about how do the task a policy that can putting the red block the final policy so that the bottom radar showing images from the robots camera and the video of horses early 2015 the reason why we really excited about this is that we had a general-purpose reinforcement learning all them that can learn not just how to put this red block into the shape sorting cube back and skills as well I can learn skills underneath an owl for different angles of the Hammer inside the robot stripper can you sing me all them for learning how to at the barrel we also found that the robot can you also use a spatula and we're pretty excited about this result we had a general purpose rain for someone over them that could acquire a wiring build upon this work to do other skills like opening a door throwing an object to header pretty timer number of lads at the same sort of algorithms for things like playing Atari games like playing go and burning locomotion we have algorithms that can acquire skills automatically bows and things like opening radio doors something very specific that's that object into that change the statue out of Returns the object 34 unity change the tablecloth that's in front of the robot be able to solve the same as true for all the things you change them small things about the film because it was trained in his one very natural but all these things are doing is running one specific task in one specific environment maybe this is a problem we can solve this problem we can just give them tablets what wallpaper to generalize natural Brown how old is the warning process behind the scenes from any of these kind of skill that looks like be attempting a task human comes in and put everything back through for the robots if they can try it again this is my friend here and we will probably not hear that you're doing more work in the right one motorway process is supposed to be very animatic look like a lot of data this way and as a result build robots and generalize diversity in the kind of things are about will see the Sunrise detailed supervision and guidance in this isn't just a problem what are the machine learning systems that we had today they can they have been able to identify the different situation one note if you want them to do something that that new would be care about robots in operating a wild ride play radio skills three specialised systems are required I think that if we hope to build machines and robots I can more generally understand and interact with the world environment and having beautiful things they needed to fundamentally rethink the way that we use Machine Mart I'm so talk about in my top today so I won't talk about how you might think about reading in the algorithms that when using or replying machine that were providing seems like the organs that when using rely as heavily on the details supervision and guidance and have to learn more general than and policy environment thinking about who are Robots for machine learning systems that isn't from just one environment that may be is inspired by some of the successes of things like image that they can generate much more broadly than the robot talk about reading the Council dog warden something more general than a policy because a policy doesn't allow us to perform a wide variety of things and a white Friday and in particular if you think about the policy that was run for the speciality ketamine used for anything robots aren't very actually I think about destination policy that's conditions somehow on the task in the environment that is in train across a wide range of tasks and environments better than the single tax policies that we were in before if you only sell the task that received her training and it's all other tasks that works missing something in terms of actually preparing robots for a while that of skills that you might want to perform the something something that is that we can use to without having no exactly what it does quickly adapt to new concept two new tyres to new environments such that when we see something that were not prepared to see training wasn't specifically for us to do we can adapt that news I think things like require a prior over summertime environments we might see you such that the functional aspects of everything that we've seen before so that we can quickly before minute ask for an learning is it allowed us to learn the structure across model tassimo learning a new task or adapting to a new environment I'll try to give a brief overview of encapsulate although actually teaching intercourse on the top again in the Four Quarters so if you want to learn more what really do the Justice trying to do is being able to try to Adare train bodybuilder Cricklade contact supervisor want to be in a new supervised learning task with a small amount of example HU11 image classifier how to draw on an image classifier from 5-days my data points were you today prank response to Different Class distinguish between each of these 5 when is giving new Images new examples are classified as examples as being among one of the five classes on the go about trying to solve the only data from other image classes use that data in a way that can prepare you for what you can do as you can structured data from other images from other women training and testing match Stratford data from other classes into the future learning task train from Minecraft from one side of a candle does for a while you can construct a wide range of tasks wiring a future planning task the robot or Wendy the system season new task on the top at test time and builder classify new examples from the very small man just fighting what works in the context of supervised learning habits of supervisor small rotavator with trailer system to build a generalized supervised learning giving a one demonstration be able to perform that situation that task and a small amount of experience in a new environment label by function you can run a policy you I look at any contact from the context of rainforests play agent really quickly and all them such that after the middle running process Direction what is potassium running for you can take the policy in run a single brilliant said backwards and you can get a policy that quickly adapting behaviour to different Ward function imitation learning so our previous work as well you've given a demonstration for objects that the robot hasn't received a force is a teleoperated demonstration today but has given this new demonstration with you also that can adapt to the objects and that seem such they can't figure out how to place the app one step further and also Medellin such a way that you can run very quickly from other sources and data such as human I can figure out that it should add this behaviour to the red two trains up trainer policy such that they can very quickly more general than accomplice the notion of very quickly build acquiring new skills quickly based on I told him that has we been able to adapt quickly to new situations based on previous experience my beliefs or adaptor internally new settings the Mediterranean distribution of task correspond to really like one task with different variations on that has 1 different objects or different Direct instead try to actually run across a very broad distribution of adaptor na terylene able to get us closer to a robot that can perform a wide range cannabis data machine learning paradigm is that a train distribution artist but where are your test is traditionally used for metal training past about the task distribution that use format 1 adaptor in TL distribution of tasks where can you get a broad distribution of tasks in the logarithms with very robotics environment that we have a good look at things like different kind of robots that you made there is a problem shared structure between us very large the prayer across all these hands at Arsenal when they don't know what is the new tax structure that the latch onto and Away consider something like the Atari learning sweet I really want to learn a new game the structure that might allow you to generalize and learn faster it's therefore that was brilliant called the Royal sweets Hounslow a lot more common structure to different manipulation generalize to a new task given on tell me about the kind of the challenge of trying to generalize to entirely new tab build a new benchmark that Aladdin the things that we want from the SpongeBob is it we wanted to have a large number of skills so we wanted to have at least 50 distinct tasks want to have more functions and success metrics for others houses all the tools to be individually solid wall so we can focus on the problem of transfer and generalization rather than focusing on the rainforest one problem itself you want a unified state space in the unified action space instructor tell me about this we built about 50 simulator manipulation tasks so I did are all shown however kindest the metal world Health Organization such as allowing us to study geography Bradley then what we have been able to so Farm what do without days actually have a train set and it has such that you can meaning please said analysation to new task for the robot hasn't been trained on hours to study more general purpose robots and robots skills they were specifically to study so we run we run better when the albums on Spotify a watermelon albums actually singers trying to generalize across if you look at a number of Stadium only algorithms like memo are all scared and Pearl success rate on the test around the 20th of May disappointing why where are they generalizing foreign why are they performing poorly are they actually doing poorly on the Mediterranean side it doesn't actually isn't the challenge does fitting a very broad rental tax then ok the natural thing to do is hold whereabouts is multitask to learn requisite multitask reinforcement learning algorithms and methods also tried to train them across all the 50 tasks so why the poor reign of hypotheses maybe there is having trouble finding how to get my word individual installable on their own so it means that we can find a solution please what are learn from scratch challenge movie The Days Garcia part 1 give the the all the Albums plenty of moral capacity capacity if you train policies independently on each other then if you train palsy is jointly on the then trying to fit them individually from a comparison or conclusion having trouble it has player passing a fit all this is having trouble after my zing for a policy they can perform all of the this always happens on holiday some of them can I have the biggest number of approaches that we saw were trying I tried to change the Architecture of the neural network in a way that could facilitate transfer that's only the pros didn't seem like there is any really principled approach for thinking about these architectures to term indicates the particular challenges that we were how would you solve the problem a couple another album instead of trying to change the architectural tried to change the Opera what is trying to do is try to wait that three different test U-turn awaiting or change the way that these past or within such that the optimisation problem and focus on making the most progress or the pasta and the most difficult for we also didn't work for 3 evenly sample all the tools and make sure they're doctors roll on have souls multitask bypasses for what baby is that the gradients from different pasta often conflicting with one another is it going to wear that we've to find that is that we seen as negative inner product between the gradients of different if the the task if there's more than 9 degree angle between the two gradients this is a reasonable hypothesis because if they were in the same direction then use his positive the only problem that it's just just build the average gradient then get the direction effectively optimises the second thing is that when they do cancer is that you have in your automation you have some of your data and the loss function is out landscape that has high curvature that looks something like this you are at this point in the operation landscape it looks like this the opposition landscape for one of the two tasks that you might be trying to optimise and maybe the other times trying to point is trying to directed to the right trying to put the primary vector2d red then According the gradient you'll suffer a song increasing while function for this task only if you actually take that stop somewhere like the last watching that basically the area that you incurred from the Complex in the gradient because that is pushing you to the right cause more damage in the loss function then was reflected in the magnitude of Figaro you tried to please is that when the two gradients are conflicting it seems like what we can do is call damage to the gradient to sort the constrained optimisation such the play the last functions of the task that you're not making any of the tasks were address this challenge here or you will try not to make this password because you might actually you work concretely the other than that we came up with for doing this is to a very very simple our rhythm I just take your existing opposition it to gradients are conflicting with one another onto the normal playing at the other gradient such that it doesn't affect its orthogonal and doesn't affect agreed I do the same thing for the other do you have to read the green one projector blue one onto the normal kind of the red wine and projected the red one onto the normal pineapple don't seem like they want it off it seems like your medicated calendars associate how much do allergy might do I go again and if you leave them alone really simple change only a few lines of code if you run this on the because this product includes ingredients for PC and if you run this on the Middle Road lynchburg we found that in comparison to training independent models are you able to significantly better after my person to Trident trailers how much quicker and also achievement creator it seems like the optimisation was the biggest to hearing by by projecting the gradient on the task over learn many many more tax you were able to Learn Together the 35 of the tasks in a single now on that work it's also worth mentioning that we try this at this time and supervising problems as well so there's a multicast example as well as a computer vision setting where you're trying to pick Simon station.in sore throat by combining this approach with architectural solutions to multitask learning such as riding networks and such as my able to boost the performance of those approaches by across the board in all why does position work we want to test if I have parcel is about the conflict ingredients and changing the direction of the gradient was when your project the gradient onto the normal plain you're actually training both the magnitude of that gradient as well as the director celebration where we compared to compare this approach with only training embarrass food or only changing the direction of the gradient and keeping the original magnitude or Direction the same first both in blue and red we found that both the magnitude and Direction Direction is really where most of the Game Informer what was quite recent the past few months and it's actually trying to go back to the middle landing setting an actually study and not just wear word across other tasks but also testing donation to entirely new first killing to Brancaster Street is hard at harder than you might think if you train a crossbow prod to ta situations such as metal world and hopefully we'll see more about drugs come out in the future and medicate optimisation issues then you can actually get positive transfer from trainee across multiple sometimes train better than train Paul's independently on YouTube algorithms please talk I showed some examples of robots learning task oriental important thank you if you give up the day that returning the dinner that sees in this case a single object or a couple of days if we feed it isn't the day that were feeding her some progress in this Direction so we've seen albums the new objects includes available in work that is the B&M the single environment and are really inherently trying to think about a single task placing objects in the containers or is it is on the front so I will see a number of works including some work your stuff as well that is able to many objects and there's also buddy at manager important for the organisation still in a single in March from the contacts and machine learning where can I use the training on very large and diverse datasets robots on doesn't compare to anything like image expect anything by the demolition image spinning Out it's really very narrow that was not really trying out robots and Status Fairview imagenet for every experiment who want to do and if you have this paradigm of CB experiment collecting imagenet and then running or in person I'll them or a robot practical what day is that with oclock image that stop thinking about how we can't read accumulated we use data across environment pictures that every institution has their own robot has their own experimental setup has their own camera we need to start investigating whether we can share data acrostic poem I think we can actually start to something like data Cross understudy and the colour first step to stay in this question is actually just watching it somewhat surprised by the visuals here 7 different platforms including window bags and robotic Google viewpoint what's the difference 39 video friends enquiry is also quite large different Institute robot isn't just a new robot platform Adidas with the different experimental little bit for contributions I think this is still doesn't listen Paris on the way but it's getting close that is useful if we can actually use this data in a meaningful way to a ginger learning in one experimental setup with one room can burn from offline datasets and whatever in person morning said from this online experience of Scotland from the policy rather than offline we're talking approach from silver prayer what is a model what the next images look like the sequence of actions you get videos that look like individual space confirm using that model using your favourite planner as long as it can skilled 2 from the day weather inspired by image the robots that can be used to generalize to an entirely new role the robots and then we find two new robot 2020 robot into a new robot a new environment new cinemas find the video tomorrow on the state we done evaluate the Model on honest FIFA demo hold-up to find tune on this Saturday we did a success rate around 40% train from scratch on my forehead and Sharpies from the cooker we get a success rate and significantly lower and it's around train from scratch on the Google was significantly more data with 1830 then if we pre-training with the Roman art and fine tune we also really famous on the front we hold that the Frank and fountain on the front and rear and getting seeing from pre-training I was much more diverse dinner set an experiment on the Baxter as well and we also saw a gain from 53% to 15% by pre-training on rubbing in the setting of here and a bison were also pretrained on only soil data and then find shoot on the backside perform the listen to us that a lot of work to be done with this very low can we add data on top of the soil data by mistake capturing the diversity all the information at the moment because of Marlow is enabled hopefully as a step in contrast to carry things like the meaning hopefully the step towards more generalizable skills in open environments but of course a lot of important directions for future work to try to mitigate some of the challenges associated with fitting is very brand fasting is 1 use data from other robots video data videos of humans doing in ways that also inform example of you go on YouTube that you can find videos that look like this for example where are you might find more modern videos nothing really good opportunity for us untapped source of dinner but I can tame many many interactions and many many environments include more sophisticated interaction actions that we can collect at Skelwith Road people using tools and people flipping objects using a frying pan frozen form more complex skills and also building generates more but there's another challenges of course so first there's a huge dimensions between the kind of videos that was here in the kinds of videos that are robot isn't access the actions that were taken by the how the human was doing the things that they do you could access the actions the actors wouldn't corresponding the same because somebody told her first step in this direction in the way that we want to do that turn from the robot learn how to use a variety of tools humans used took some examples are visited videos of humans they said it's really easy in comparison to teleoperation data of the robot using tools interaction data such as the kind of robots in randomly in the we learned a pretty model videos here is how do you learn a predictive model you don't have the actions and what you have done tell me a process problem is formulated underlying the data that we have we decided tomorrow very where's only observed in the setting where you have interactions and not observed in the sitting room and then we have a lane acting very busy that's modelling essentially the intentions of the agent whether it be a human or a robot lastly we have a domain variable that capturing basically the differences between the robot domain and the human domain and it is observed that we know whether that will be human or a video of the Robber tomorrow with these like variables and an optimising used using variational inference about organising that so how was it tomorrow tomorrow 11th the operation data trim BP which is a standard video Prix tomorrow but that doesn't have the ability to learn from videos of humans can we trade on the red and robot interaction data that was the standard model that was trained both with red and robot interactions as well as demonstrations kinaesthetic demonstrations are robots using tools or we can observe 2-m stated video production metrics that measure the quality of the person that was born able to outperform Ronaldo's training only on the start to apply anaesthetic meaning of significant because play the views of the Robin and trying to get anything out of the sorry the human really a heart we actually care about improved used to towards better operations can we give a task trying to move on play the movie coronavirus to the right where it's give me what pasta use a tool to use this Lee this pencil cases at all the pussies objects over to the Rain I can figure out by planning with it's one predictive model how to grass the object and move in this case the goes to push a pair onto up we had the task of putting some trash near and I can't figure out how to cross the the sweeper and use it how long is it is the operation Ajax improving task performance and parent just using interaction data and we found that we see a significant gain in the success rate by using the ox play The Robot was able to by watching humans include a pervert I think accumulate and use all the available day that we have it another word for data from Steptoe Elizabeth I guess it's also this idea really isn't this is going to be a person everyone in the machine learning community has been taken to build more generalizable models of language models of images etc I'm sorry trying to take her but it's outside of the dark ages and he wearing only training here machine learning models on visually so everything over them and rethink Our Data so that we can try this Guild about broadcaster submissions by mitigating somebody optimisation challenges and took Amelia version offline Davis MLB stream by doing so we can maybe tell about yourself one Step Closer do you have a robots what's text little bit about open calendars I really think about a very concrete example may be remarkably challenging for the current things that you had today but also remarkably easy for example you have maybe a kitchen environment calendars make a bowl cereal in that the task I mean that are familiar with all the towns really a grand challenge and something calendar simple if you can think about steps that can bring us closer to going in a new environment and doing really a simple skill in that environment skill that requires reasoning about personal ability reading about long like dependencies in a longer Horizon closer to having systems that are more intelligent and have more comments ticket tout I can do something like this behaviour open world environment systems that can continuously improve from there that they clocked on the road start with more simple skills like some of the skills that we saw earlier but toward more and move towards more more environment in Warwick innocent president in a battalion address of individual calendar adapting to a new environment that you haven't seen before what we can do this is actually the contacts so you can do the online and we have a little bit of work and I'm trying to see how relaxing adapt with very small amount of data to new environments switch on another account in a moving towards the school I think is to move towards longer hasn't asked Horizon schools if you need to figure out how to boost right from the Horizon skills towards Longhurst another way that we can do that is through things like early work on this Direction were you trying to offer my house for a sub goal stream together sequence it's cold I didn't one considerable Rescuers that if we want to continuously however it's confusing than improve like in perform in warm or general environment when does that might come up as one of the improvement is too slow whatever actually get to the kitchen environment at the end getting better is it simply too things like meta-learning can actually come in as well if we can over the process of radius equal to skills at the Beginning going very slowly because I'm from get faster and faster at learning based on the experience that you seen so far salary does process improvement and hopefully get to work environment what's l interest in learning more about some of the algorithm advances in this Direction as I mentioned earlier I'm city of course on multitasking and learning in the Four Quarters and actually all the selections will also be available on YouTube djerassi PD in the future in the context of reinforcement learning for my course at Berkeley on deep reinforcement learning which has been concluded videos of there are also available online and really these two forces capture a lot of the kinds of algorithms and methods that I was talking about also reinforcement learning courses at Berkeley and such as some of the causes that emigrants guilty and my students in my class and I'll be happy to take a few 2 questions I like the dinner relaxation performance how do we really so when we possible environment how can we really know understand the limitations different to say image that the robot has to interact with environment do you think it's better to take quality data is there a way to do that the original question I basically want to learn some behaviours and poles here's a model how do you know Santa the derivation of the in general I think anyway sometimes in somewhere this Falls under the problem of uncertainty quantification like giving them all in giving a new data can my model tell me whether or not it can tell us that water work in that direction although in the context of deep learning in neural networks at the very very challenging problem hope to do that thing that we just brought in are feeling distribution we can hope to cover that task or that setting that you're going to see that didn't want to see it last time cases me think about anything about giving my data can I get my robot to dry how can I brighten my data um2 work on my data and think about how to go back in very large datasets as essentially the kind of work that I was showing at towards Thursday and we want to generalize and use data that very broadly applicable and covers the kind of situations he might want to see it last time question you're asking about the update for robots we have One Direction and we may want that interaction to contain more sophisticated interactions with the world busy quality over quantity is actually is really important and I think that we should I show today as they were trouble we random interactions with learn how to use a spatula to the object that it isn't going to help you very much you are going to get very far to the performing complex task I think that will be thinking about both both quality and quantity when we got his ears and what they want to do next and says that is start augmented with more sophisticated interaction so there is some other work at Stanford example that's how we can reschedule teleoperation and that maybe one way to get more sophisticated interactions of robots interacting in a wide variety of settings are using reinforcement learning as well so if you actually start going from a standing start learning skills in UFC deploy policies are learnt to collect more data in a wide range of environments such that you can start to get more interesting interactions and interactions of the right actually trying to do castelo Branco directed way while still trying to maintain the quality because I think the quality and where the Bratz not just for the breath of the data is in really credit card for generalisation the dataset imagenet classification space perhaps in terms of the number of pixels in a bit speaker you can have is coming in in the video input can you extend over time your children all trajectory so can we maybe save it who is actually doesn't have that much friends because it's only because of images that you would take like with the camera it doesn't contain like all the other kinds of observations are robots that the human see is taken from my clitoris something like the things that you would take pictures and then I say doesn't capture a wide range of images that robots might see in the environment especially mobile robots and basically all these viewpoints and you might like the bread that we might need for robots actually my brother than what we need for something like that rip computer vision like you're having humans cut video enough kind of low-cost robot frozen but out there so I can do that then we might actually be able to that sounds really wide range of situations and maybe much of a range of situations in the kind of things that you see with that that there is there is some hope there for trying to capture that really that brought distribution but the same time I do think that really There's Gonna Be situation but the robot sees it has time then tonight simply because of how huge the spaces and situations where humans are in in that all the time and need ultimate older and second reason about number for that's really a tremendous challenge as well beyond final Paul Burnett and extraction but I think is the key for human being able to be seen because no space in comparison to black box but you don't want to know everything that you try to have your network model all that dinner then you was going to hit a wall at some point because it's not possible tomorrow everything in the world you have to figure out what the Disco this card is really I think also credit card challenge what you describe need to also be informed by functionality by symantec someone that is going to have to come from human and so is that right about everything and model only the tasks that humans care about somewhere to some of the building things that talk about it only moral prior over human relevant skills open the towns are comes in is like how do you define the things that are relevant does is it human is it some part of the discount trying to figure out what it is that's alright it's impressive you an artificial intelligence like what do you like watching people what do you throw open challenge in two and two together for each task in the batch we do the same procedure didn't want to be symmetric and then we free talking about really simple order about the other the first one that goes in project then you take the results of that and go onto the second task
