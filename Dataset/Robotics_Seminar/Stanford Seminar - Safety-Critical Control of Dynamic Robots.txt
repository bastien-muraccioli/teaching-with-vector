it's a pleasure to be here this is actually my first time at Stanford somehow what's the pleasure to see the campus talk about control robotics safety critical control you'll see this message come up time and time again do I really want to spend one minute just thinking my stuff when's it made the stock really happened that me and all the collaborators I have that's just a partial list I work with a bunch of amazing bring these ideas add mobile on you try and try and try again to get something to work this is an outtake of Us trying to get running on in the kids to play Robot so as you can see in 4-ft and back for not side to side and we try this for 9 months again and again and again and again until I just fell apart at what happened we got this we finally got the running at came together it was beautiful right so everybody knows this is the video right that little segment when everything's just finally going just the way it should there's not so much that we got to find a video that did everything checked out ok it's what it took to get it to work Returns outfit for the secret sauce the magic was not just trying for 9 months and turn about your games but actually going back to the drawing board talking to my students missing Chelsea the radiator that tells you when you're doing things right a lot to tell you when you're doing things wrong mazamet map for doing wasn't quite enough we had to introduce the notion of input to state stability and once we did that it works in like 3 days the couple run sweetheart run the lesson here is not so much you know TuneIn and I get the thing but rather let's use now what is matter Bridge the gap between what we understand about robotic system play sea Explorer is the Major underpinning of this talk that's a major underpinning mi rece understand this car something where I do some math we prove it something what happened with check it and see what's the first time to make that stop being said I'm going to talk about a bunch of applications of these ideas imagine is Marco pointed out by Peter robots in Lego robots are Canada bread-and-butter of my lab for a long time they provide great examples of systems were success and failures it's wonderful binary it had a water falls on its face safety critical control though and a variety of robotic systems and finally the applications of these ideas to robot is really the place where we can take our knowledge and actually put it to an application domain that can help restore mode that being said I'm going to start with the little bit of math because I'm bound to you by law that's Celtic law where I have to have at least a couple of films in my eye and so they begin with my control the oven off really simple people that picking under control will find this if you haven't taken any non-linear control I think the ideas themselves are very approach 1892 we opened up came up with this idea looking at the energy function associated with mechanical systems 1980s song title please ideas to control sister Livesey first we have full non-linear Dynamics we oh darling your sister my minister matinelle fine destiny considerably Alpin or function function basically I bought just like this picture in the looks like a boat that goes from Arran to r&n has nice positive definite structure the main ideas that if you when you differentiate this functional want Solutions of assist play the derivative of this function looks like a stable in your system unnecessarily going to have Convergence of that function to convergys 20th in your state or convert 0 pence will stabilize story short to find the stability of an n-dimensional system amounts just checking the derivative of this funk despises proper the way I like to think about this is who's ever seen his fair games right where you put the coin play Minnesota State Fair run from myself I then made my wife staying in front of this and take pictures with me in she did it any ideas this is the optimal functioning that's alright as long as things are heading downwards you know the ultimately and what is this this means if we can find an import or system control who does the right thing do the right thing that makes this video the exponentially stabilise your system 20 understand this basic idea that all you need to do is find a function by the satisficers condition you can send DS a particular one way to do this would be as a quadratic just say give him my input find any input the satisfy this subject to any cost I want this is our which is continuous controller and the right conditions and in fact as a closed-form solution it's a quadratic program because you see up there in the math the input is that fine in the cinema today program which as you know is a convex problem would be solved that to kill her this basic mathematical Anakin the film itself is that so important now what you just have a blocked if there is a theorem example that we have stable robotic Walker serum Institute what's there's a lot of stuff on the phone here the references are there of the took the first couple generations of robots I worked on these were custom built in my lower back in the day simple by today's standards but at the time was really awesome to see if you realise this is a serious feel by Jonathan her cos you this is actually the precursor to Cassie which oscillator turn on really works the one problem with what I just told you is that the steering works but the capitation institution of this terms actually really hard are these conditions you have to synthesizers the open all function so the other important all this matter I showed you is the algorithmic Thomas math we have to write it in the end as an algorithm it so one of my students without a house Frost stixall the steering ball this method stated as a as a in particular turned on when you're a constrained optimisation problem using location methods etc so in about 5-minutes we can go from the map what's video on the riders a result of this application problem put on the robot fairly cleaning what happened happened they really were taking the trajectories from the opposition problem talking about the robot we raided algorithms and ultimately realise it on hard loud that look because it's very general you just search up I to whole bunch of different robotics this is Doris again but now this is there a store in Malta contact Walker can talk about it but under the hood of all these things is a hybrid system model if you know hybrid systems that means we have four different discrete domains for this walking mod we happen all functions and all these domains play here is that natural heel toe contact is there cheetahs human-like walking the second important point is that Doris didn't notice that has spring started actually has passive Dynamics that we have delivered to achieve this lock is one of the most efficient examples of robotic walking ever realised in my opinion because we're leverage in the not inherit non-linear Dynamics of the system to achieve still love this video it's a couple years old now but it's still think it's awesome everything and the forces that this was done by two graduate students one being a young and the a short period is we have to deal with less resources in lightsaber the right the other domains to know because it's not it's general so this is actually really recent result now or we take the same ideas that is with this method of generating Gates informal controls for for bipedal robots in apply to quarter water pad we just need a quarter pad as to bipeds that are connected by reaction forces at that the walking robots that can holding hands through the torso because of the quadrupeds structure we can generate dates for quadrupeds in about 3 sec seconds from button to realise it in a hardware using a full non-linear Dynamics of the system that is there is overdue tomorrow's here this is just straight order dynamics extensibility of the Urdu interesting things support of writing about quarter past is there really robot taking the quadrupede on this route system right outside my office account tickets to little airtime write about I was actually shooting this video this in turn direction and we were kotronas Direction it just started coming right at so I was Cana for a moment wondered whether this was the moment that robots take over the world analyse 10ml on this robot time price safe not the point is that we can apply the silver different the final bit of course in this light is of the same ideas apply to different bipedal robot so this is Cassie this is built turn up light it doesn't matter that the legs are inverted it doesn't matter there's Springs everywhere in the mouth is the it's just that we had a really nice evening between the cinema he is unlike yours is it meant to go in more natural terrain environment so we can take it around la we could even take it outside on rough terrain a single gate that we generate troll doing all of these things Eurobus what's happening to handle the train vs this environment first here again is to demonstrate that that is reasonably even with robustness and reasonable sensibilities your some jumping the same idea that once we know the match reply to a bunch of different domains not just different robots for different job that was Joe Keane this is back walking now controller same framework 2 m per second which is pretty good even though like I mentioned were not playing for this washing speed is just one controller running all been behaving just for fun understand what we can certainly think about doing more complicated autonomous Maneuvers so in this case were trying to walk around the square a walking robot with like skecher replica practice where will we can do is is use this framework to actually understand what your doctor is are allowable around the square then corresponding League vs possible so I just showing that with the mask comes this repertoire different environments earlier wardrobe Austin world of this awesome I need to show that it has limits in these are the live turn my shoulder earlier in the quarter bed but now for the biped it doesn't quite how to tell me from the video but these roots are good 3:45 in deep places so this is it's not remember there is no cameras on this robot it's not looking at the train is not doing for placement this is just the robustness of the non-linear controllers to unknown thankfully the robot was not home wake up and walk this also sure that shows the limits to what we can do in terms of just applying Theory without thinking about the environment that were in Iraq leads to the second point of the stock play the talk is safety critical control and some ways of stuff I talked about earlier was this what is a note for a long time see you later face QPR fairly new when you can do magical things with them but it doesn't get us where we want to be in a safety critical control can't stabilizer do you want to make every system say we need something more general than the other where can I introduce controlled barrier we are open up like extension I want to start with a little history because I think it's really important sometimes in macadamia we could call up and just talking about the paper we published 6 months ago and that's awesome but these things go back a long way office notion of safety the time to finally here goes back to new gumo and 1940 I'm here was lost in time at least two or three individual times when it was rediscovered independently multiple time back to him and 1942 you can imagine this was kind of a bad time for the world so you can see why beginning with we have damascan following on your daddy and makes no assumptions except all soon after find a safe search now we can argue about whether this actually defined safety or not but for these purposes I'm going to say safety is staying inside a sexy the status for in Buried initial condition in the set means the solution station to set for altar any particular were going to define ourselves as being the super level set of a function h the functions that map from Ireland to our through it all of its positive values to find the sea what does it mean to be safe in this context that is stay inside the check that we don't have solutions at the system so we need some sort of derivative like condition 22 figure this out a long time ago 80 years ago metaphor have a controller that is we just have dynamic play Simple and into derivative of a cholong solution ODEON times of Vector field is positive along the boundary of your set can you date your service for ordinary are you going to for the variance but because the other way me neither necessary and sufficient conditions for safety that is set in various interesting really fundamental the ideas into if H is the earth if your sexy is defined by HB parser boundary age can only grow or stay 0 than 8 itself has to stay positive add clear that's that's clear why that might be is extended a long time after the Google support 2007 resources some of this in Obama's book from 99 take this notion of safety from the goo play to the horse this was a control we had this condition and start being positive now we have a controller existing control input such as this is true for all points in my set then myself will be safe it's just vowels from The Goonies convince by that as long as this age.is positive we can't leave the sun problem way to conserve can you check this condition on all points in your set play me every super level set of 8 rapidly there but if you started with 8 being greater than some positive constant be greater than a positive constant that was this entire stage where do I start smaller region but that's not what we want from safety can safety should be I can come all the way to the edge of the stage without falling off can you come how to extend the new mysterious to the entire set 2014 so not that long Brazil and power top and we came up with this idea that there must be a nice way of extending it in particular and this is a keeper Fallout 8.2 actually go negative some have to go naked as you can approach the band can you take your Sony over the boundary the right as you approach the boundary must go to here is what state to State Fair condition and let's bounded below by - gamma this is a classic a function for those that know those that don't consider the constant so when you're inside your settee just passed how to buy a negative no age.can exigo negative India boundary set this becomes zero turns out that this and this is important point is this is necessary and sufficient for entire set mean if you check any point in your set if this is satisfied it's true if and only if you're safe play this by the way just I was able to find the scrap of paper will be first or down this screenshot but this is the idea so what can we do with this so now that I done them believe what I just said and you're welcome to check it out it's automatic safety as a simple the above do it just like with an object is in a quadratic we can take any desired input you happy any Desire controller this could come from a machine learning algorithm this you come from something you don't know you don't trust through the safety-critical controller by just picking the you that's closest to the existing you subject to the safety can what is solution if you want it so this is easy dissolve in real-time and second we can filter input here is a Segway ICT is a Segway stay 18 degrees timer top we have a PC control and bookcase whoever PD control on the top control the overshoot in the Segway Falls filter the input through the barrier function and we stay within this set always because of the Fair Tiana would the Simon show some applications that we made it through the mouth part but I think it's important understand what these things mean that one more bit of understanding that I think is very interesting this is a trivial statement in a trivial proof but it's actually I don't want to say is a phone it turns out that the set of all the opener functions add a subset of the cellar barbarian funk we are open or functions are a special case of area funk is a point and keep you in the set for the actually stabilise you didn't set outside of the sun this right here you haven't lost anything by going to Paris Special K something because inside the safe says we can move around freely but we know we won't leave the what's the stuff in act who is the apples of this was actually came up Georgia tech with MS if you don't know is more time robots system guru at the time of the Robert carrier pid of the overturned matching say and I was like that's great the adios Robert Aryan was people were going to have this mother robot test around the world can implement their code on this test you should try the section of course but the point is that what is the first thing people do when they put their code on robots you should say that's right what is barrier functions as a safety filter is a safety layer on the robotarium to prevent the robot from minimally invasive way that is we want them to implement our algorithms and programs are right we want to do any tell me one an example in this case imagine the user to the Robert arium implemented over then we want this robot to go straight robot go straight across the search switch off with a barrier function that is safe region around the robotomy see they're coming in coming in it looking down play the barrier takes over in a fight with over to a force field around all these spinning here of course is that there is no plan in happening centralise decision making process that they should touch the spin in Sun Direct latest cars in tirol off each other get free of each other and can go to the altar it's true for different types of robots is same idea a human controlling a drone 4 drones are all on auto what you going to do is try to crash one drone into the others what happened steam preventing them from hitting each other is the Barrier from note that this is done on the phone and then you're the name of the system that differential flatness cos you nice way to synthesizers barriers even through the phone and then dynamic behaviour with all these asses stop couple more supposed to show it's not limited the multi-robot systems this is actually a video done by my post off what was the paper on at this is an automotive application with Lane you have a look find the lane controller is keeping the car in the lane diet is a human's you can see here on the left is like control down in the car on the right is it singles don't align all the time because the humans trying to drive the car out of the way is taking over when you get here the boundary the way so this is a safety feature applications web applications the automotive industry in this context more application is an interesting where can I get a little bit especially with my stuff say peaches on both so turns out this was supposed to in this case the barrier function is going to hit the dock is driving the boat in trying to round about in the dark in the barrier function takes over in Charlie's videos is examples of very different dynamical in said a little bit of recent research that I think is interesting is everything here assume this is what is a model-based driven Jason becomes what about the real world what if we don't have perfect models of this exercising till learning A Hero's don't learn the whole Dynamics don't get really filter learning brother let's take the real world instantiation of the system and learn the deficits as they relate to the barrier function so we can enforce safety even if we don't have perfect match completely this is the process and it's a very simple straightforward application of learning the non-trivial partners applying it to the bear function purplebricks man in the station as you would imagine and in this case for doing is looking at her the difference between what age we would predict two different the model vs eh that were actually observing from the system it's plato's as close as possible that is learn this remainder term start the ribbon of such the everything lines are perfect can we learn this week hopefully can guarantee masonic learning approach it's like on actual hardware so this is the other boring point is actually really works on hardware this was a demonstration done about a month ago so on the top within without learning so without learning what happens because I'm certainly in the model you're going to go on safe the learning means that we've learnt these deficits Dynamics and hence we can keep the system safe even with uncertainty play kind of application for looking at the Millennium plus control domain is take your model sticker and mathematical understanding cities very dynamic non-linear c note is some other recent work or doing is on the MPC reporting note for a couple reasons skippys in the barrier functions that I showed you or not MP in a multiple aspects of the same in it yourself in an optimisation problem these work for the phone landed and Emma to the system as it's nowhere near zacian need if you know what's for the linearized Dynamics for Elias is can we bring these to the Stu the MPC is that lets you look out over a longer time with you can only work instantaneous can we take that time window and add straight to the longer time will get better performance starting to understand that turn hardware because that's what really matters so I'm getting back to the Segway were starting to play with all these different situations of seal fup see you in a combination there understand the best way to do optimization-based control online on these dynamic Road of course is the handle on certainty and every passing some video about a week ago now Jack uncertainty at all levels so we have uncertainty in state estimation so that means the same as I really know where it is we have an early tomorrow all this uncertainty Zadar security safety in this case safety is staying with in this region and staying upright you and all those things at the same time properly model and heddle then certainly we can stay safe early Doors that's where we're heading on the safety I am bringing safety Halloween Burnley Opening example robot system around already in a short period of time play I want to talk about one more important piece of the robotics world that when you focus everything we've done so far has been on a low booking you control serious this is this is your natural domain right we have Dynamics and we we do things like a void things we stabilize things roll20 play comes now how do we bring another levels of decision-making this is now in economy beyond systems what you need to do not just about the low-level continuous domain but also this discrete level decision-making dummy can we bring these layers together 10cc no typically these things are done in the highly decouple I'm in stabilizing system whatever stable system they give it to the computer scientist the computer scientist does about your planning with that and get her to do more macro level be I miss these two ideas can you tell me the motivation for doing this on the market decision process about this actually relatively recent the Mars 2020 mission Rover in a help do I have a 2 minutes of Flight obviously can go basically all day on HR how do you corn 80 different robotic cyst what's the coronation problem because he component obviously you don't want the helicopter crash animation playing in passing comp helicopter will have a lot more information at the macro-level than the Rover does at the sort of local you think about all these things together so we were done this in the in the context of Markov decision process experimental demonstration of what segway and this is the helicopter this is a completely autonomous demonstration meeting go and then nothing else singer is there each utilising their own capabilities in the context of America decision process to build a better image or better representation of the word Rover went out a confined the Staples of the Hill captain at the environment information back to the key associated with the Rover in the rover knows where they go and ultimately can get there with high probability bring these two pieces together on the planet what did I ignore in this whole process this time funky banana Alexandra control this wonderful about 18 as demonstration it even though that was completely autonomous and my students hit the button and then it went was a Thomas the 100 Time a hit play previous time it did things like I was recording this in the night I freaked out because the drone started going like this there's a time delay that propagated through the system and ended up flying into a wall and breaking you a million pieces happen so often rebuilt the drones that would hit a wall and break apart and they could resemble it right there to run another expert very robust if you plan on the same breaking apart Milly pieces you can rebuild it right I'm not I'm not darling my students but I'm telling you saw the need for safety critical examples of drawn thing I showed earlier when time-delay is propagated through the motion capture they would collide even though we're probably safe safe is probably safe subject to the assumptions you're making on the you seen the segway for model are final component at the technical level which is doing safety going to do safety critical pondy the settling lcl is all connect backup without the bottom particular strawberry what is Pontypridd we have you sorted probabilities that tell you were going to go and give a time given some discrete structure on the sea thing is that you can write these Ponty PCs as discrete-time dynamical is there a problem it goes back to some work in 2013 I wear the hat is the formula for the evolution of the system my poster to this work as well and the important point is you can understand this discrete system in it Evolution at a probability level through this discrete-time dynamical system and we can start to reason about this discrete-time dynamical system now and safety there we could define barrier functions for discrete-time dynamical buy Kelso for the just normal discrete-time case Elstree not the it's a very see exactly what you would expect this is a discrete-time sorted derivative subject to a class k function a barrier functions for this discrete evolution of the system these we can prove that in fact these are necessary and sufficient for safety talked about earlier but now I didn't remember we're doing at this discrete level this probability level for the system ever skip for this level you can make sure your robots 4th April don't hit objects in the environment that planning interesting brilliant answer to think about doing things like having multiple sets for you intersect them and you union you're doing now is Interstate 8 in specification patience might be always stay within a collection of sets swimming in the section or stay within the universe different behaviours you can write this as barrier function conditions on the Pond dynamical system associated with the pond the final point which creator hole punches specification what's of temporal logic specifications why did the two I showed you earlier there's a whole bunch of other specifications you could do it as high decision-making level that is you can formally verify that your system satisfies you specification barrier function do what I showed you earlier which is filter any given policy actually meet your specifications even if your original policy did it listen here as we've gone from continuous level Dynamics where I took a control policy and I filtered it I modified it security safety and now at the discrete planning level we can also filter a policy so that we guarantee ultimate ears in Multiple levels contact for looking to realise this on multi-robot system specifically heterogeneous multi-robot might have their own barrier functions on them at the continuous level the Segway does turnout at the discrete level uses pontipee represent where to find a simple in this case it's a Christmas present that was stormed in December so Christmas play YouTube these robots have their own party pieces interacting through information and probabilities are being passed between all these robot most capable locomotion robot goes out capable robot and in the end the environment with reasonably high probability they know where the obstacles are and hence they can send the final in this case the Rover to actually go retrieve the same tuatara me a multiple to actually extend this even further could what I did so far was sort of channel safety at the street level adding interaction level up this is actually a movie that my student stopped working ready for a Labrador and I walked in the lab they were just doing some time to waiting for lads Chinese robots is not a fan of using kind of see how close they can get the robot I just like friend and they do this clearly for a passing information by doing it so the question is how do we add this to this is suitable planning geraghty safety this is not guaranteed but also we can use coordination and collaboration between robot even at a dynamic level to make decision making and doing stop taking through the map will take it to the theory let's get to the final piece in a remaining minutes what I think is really so no more happy maths were done with that you've now graduated to the does the reward at the end of the rainbow which is things like robotic assisted show the applications of these ideas and I think robot assistants is one really wonder you can actually make a real impact on people what is the video I shot earlier humanoid robot walking robots walking understand how they work in a mathematical level what is that imply we help people walk play for thing but it's quite so simple for mathematical but this is essentially what we're doing in my library now so first this is a prosthetic this is the 3rd gen prosthetic rebuilt from scratch on my lap is running a quadratic program in real-time as a controller play up now trains in the controls to the device we generate gates for the prosthetic as if it was a human or robot that is we take the human we generator model the human another prosthetic and regenerate formally stable Gates that we put on the device is there transition from Robot walk in the prostate network in the real world to my graduate schemes working outside with the device showing the robot prospects as a really wonderful companion very robust making prosthetics walkright you don't really know how much is the prosthetic for the human in this case they can walk with a second application that I find incredibly compelling which is accessed a couple years ago this is joint work with Jessie Bristol Michigan and Berkeley and the idea was it we know how to make robots exoskeleton set humans make them what dynamically hence make people walk dynamically even if they can't walk on them serum H showing through the hotel 14 paper and it's this theorem represented algorithm that's living on this device that I'm just about to show you joint workout should say a lot of joint working all the mechanical design in oven for done by wonder in Paris France who's the vice walking stable dynamically the mass under the surface to see the stable period device can walk play in the device in walk with complete purple eater play No function of his life whatsoever and hasn't for 10-years as far as we know the first example of purple ever walking without crutches with an exoskeleton has walking dynamic three examples in their pen over 20 people that are now clinically this exoskeleton technology in me is the ultimate application of an idea where you can Creuset matthewson that's all wonderful but in the end is had a real impact on their own powerful and Henry want to take it for that success what's called the Rams initiative a Celtic robotic-assisted mobility science in it to develop more advanced controllers for Xbox skeletons in this is now in my lab is wearing the device is not purple legic thankfully but we can she can wear the device and we can test that ideas on this device in the lab and how much faster lubre clinical examples of that the first one I really like to tie together when I talk about early function soyoustart barrier function represented into who is the ideal issues vary from assistant on Xbox who is so so far the results I showed you on the Xbox elton's we generated stable walking gate 4 it had no impact whatsoever on what the answer was doing there were literally along for the Ride it's awesome but it's also just it just forces you to go through what if the person doesn't have a complete spinal cord injury by partial spinal cord Porsche assistance variable I'm sick here is let's take to nominal trajectory southern the green lines are seen or the probably stable trajectories that will result in Walking we take to go around the tubes to find your barrier who is by changing is gamma how aggressively we stay away from the boundary of the two it's more or less depending on what we want to do as we can do very bossy is this been tested with different assistance Ian and Thomas are doing the tests my graduate is measuring metabolic cost can you seen how much work she's doing related to the assistance level were off probably for doing this right for for assistance you should do less work than for partial assistance right because she should start to have to do some eight subjects just to be farrell and we did discuss in 20-30 minutes of amenable Casey and any results we found exactly what we hoped which was that in fact were doing very put input into the movement of the system with the barrier functions that they have without application another one is to serve bringing learning into the mix please you can do learning in this context the first is actually at the controllable kind of like when I talk about the barriers in this case were doing a proof-of-concept demonstration we take an hour and then controller were playing on the device and then the orange and does all the control module places being 100% control buy in Ireland we have the building the learn is complicated controllers and instead she ate them in real time is the one doing input into the system the Ireland's talking to the motor Lola book do learning at a high level learning the decision maker context what interested in is deciding what gate to actually put on the door what we doing with general all these Gates showed you we put them on the device the person what's with it what date will the user prefer stop let me figure out what date is best for a personal lease maybe you can but I don't know how to do it what person likes best is to what Mr preference-based Lorena turns out there's a really powerful in essence what we're doing is learning the cost function of the person by asking in there what is the source of binary decision process that turns out we can prove mathematical it's really nice properties of convergence colouring is cost that is do you like this cable this cake do you like this kind of this cake about doing that just like when you get your glasses checked right it's a binary decision Ali's optimal cost you can see the conversion after multiple try make an action in what you're going to see now is a budget trial try the human subject says they like what they would like the correspondence for the cost function returning updated accordingly until we fine off in one direction meaning changing one variable the system on the xor model exciting area when suffering learning together with dynamic control call guarantees the properties of the system in the learning let you pick what you like best I went to a lot of my I would do like a robot video cheers something I obviously firmly believe in I'm another control theory so that's found to be what I say PC with all the movies that least they're somewhere to doing that right stability and safety with the Aberavon barrier I talk about the extensions that to atana me better word for doing 11 in a court order all in the end was the bridge the gap how do we Bridge the gap no we had would you much better but there is a whole bunch of work to do on getting things that work the first time every time on robotic system so we have a lot of work to do and that a tool I showed you there we are problems with special case of area so this includes the upper I was actually really useful to better Bridge this gap and that's the subject of future when I want to make is that it's our job as robot-assisted think about the real-world applications to what ways that were thinking about this so I want play the couple of days bringing robots in the public I think this is a service we can do this one for us and that demo robots in toddlers learning and we are just some of my favourite pictures and videos of kids reacting to robots I could always find this to be awesome this one was amazing we were just came up with the robot women's light grey cabinet connection to get kids excited about robots in Martin interviewing and everything else of course there's also applications to real world I I don't have a company I don't want to set the company I'm not interested in that domain but some of my students do so in this case one of my phone PhD students is the city of weather on Hamburg flipping a hamburger is essentially the same as making a robot private insole you have to deal with this friction has to be a dynamic hoover that so we were together on this was actually employed in in Cali burger in Pasadena and a couple of her kallenberger location so I cooked by algorithms that my lad came up with which is really cool world applications of course the real world application and the most excited about right now show me possible because working with the company that does critical testing ID that in my life images that earlier but these are a bunch of patients testing the exoskeleton in looking at this behaviour and the great thing is we can start to look at what they think using the device and we can make decisions based on their thoughts about closing that look generate better and better controllers that we ultimately deploy in a clinical I want to note that these videos is really powerful is that Deezer clinician it's not engineers another Level transition is when you can have it devices for Boston up to be clinically deployed without engineers necessarily running the device so that's wondercraft and that's their engineer that cabaret where is the following is in the real world at working with people this case this was a video where this is just a sooner caltex she's not in my life she's just sitting on the the talking to you and I thought it was cool because this is sort of the interaction you'd like to see you very much for that go for it discrete-time dynamical question the question was that these bluespace Dynamics are sarcastic in nature so what modifications do we have to make to the barrier the head also cast DMX we get a discrete-time dynamical system that updates for probability forecasting period for say that being said you can also treat things stochastically and do the little plastic barrier functions has been at work not in my group but other groups Headingley Stokes which perspective you want to what is a discrete-time dynamical system update in the probabilities at every game evolution Sarah sarcastically Angeles forecast adjusting area2d tango bachata barrier functions for Albert Square John Lewis table lights why is my how do we synthesise bear hardly explain all the windows something that lasts over throughout the whole it seemed like you just popped out the barrier for yourself and then you put on your system in the world is a wonderful place what I did with the tubes around the trajectories for the back so is much in line with what you had if you longer Horizons walking robot you have a periodic trajectory you want to keep a barrier function around the trajectory we've also done things like step functions for the placement of where is around you can change how the foot is being placed on size of bears actually quite easily because it's that the barrier function itself to find this set as a tube you can look at you know making sure the norm Norm distance from your periodic orbit is less than some easy the problem is you don't know if that's set that your defining by age is controlling very existing input that will keep you in that will tell you the input might not be what is a generating feasible imports to keep a set in very very very hard prob over here now working on and a couple contacts also should say that a lot of work to spend on the pasties in recall the equations it'll give you a better function teddies feasible with respective inputs of course that's not a computationally feasible who won into this issue that is and I don't want to Pretend It's not there do you have with similar functions in synthesizing a function dynamically every time that you pee is generated in go to be satisfied by the actual winners is a heart thing a very buncha PhD topics it in there for probably the next 10 years because it ties into the fundamental questions about dynamical systems things like control in German NCA Russia real like you program for every question answer the question was the actual Skelton stuff I showed his general means anybody gets in this device and I didn't talk about this but it's actually I'm glad you asked could I get to see this now is that it's not general there great things it doesn't have to be meaning what we do is actors in this case is because and they actually build the plant Frost that framework I talk about our lives today took Frost that package and modified I'm really well my reading in the XO is you measure a patient cup of tea measurements from there you can use it look at biological textbooks and getting estimate of their mass and also distributes for the pair start with the model vs great model to generate stable walking Gait that's patient-specific just take a couple minutes 5 minutes Close Gates they can generate like 1020 dates they try out a couple see which one the patient is patient specific and customisable to again that's a great question oh so right now actually doesn't even really allow for last for preferences only on a Mac in a couple binary choices so what's been implemented clinically right now is there they generate a collection of Gates they put them on the XO the patient where is it tries one they can give some high-level feedback to the clinician and pick another day and then that's enough preference based learning was in someone's trying to mathematically qualified that process and actually generates a really nice was not time based it was purely Gate based at this moment Homebase can you rather than saying I want a home Newgate the patient should be able to say I want my need to go with a hire out the gate I want to take a little bit longer I'm saying and that would be awesome to add these sort of modifications around time-sensitive fashion we've not touch that yeah but that will be will be really interest off 15 invite someone tried to push it to the world the question was how does the device react to conflict in Bury to the earlier point which is better single barrier function dynamically feasible meaning is controlled by controlling that you're good to go mean if you started that there's no way you're going to hit the wall because you verify the header time that you can hit the wall and very functional early B intersection in how much more the easier way would be just out of budget constraints in your QB with all your bear despite all of the same so in that case you'll have to get Smart either with the synthesis by intersecting your you need to make sure it becomes Curran Max problem there's a whole bunch of stuff in that like that you have to take it let's start a real problem that requires Jorge cortes and Megan still nice paper on doing min Max continuous-time barriers I talk about mean axon discrete-time there's a little bit so there's a whole the whole thing to do to try and do this but yeah I don't want to imply that you just decide about our strong together and hardware it safe you're done right play video Axel Skelton videos so in the exoskeleton videos the question swinging their arms a little more than you through arm Innocence that these were the zora purple lyrics with injuries from the waist down so they have an upper body torso and they're in they are helping to stabilize the device can we show the video with the EXO walking without a patient it what's the proven in fact that I can walk on its own being said that human will help to stabilize it further device itself in The Walking wall stable could be stabilized further made more robots working on the control that's all there the humans helping with but that's what you're saying is they don't feel that the gate like it so they swinging
