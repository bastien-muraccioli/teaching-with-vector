thank you all for coming today we're going to talk about control for robotic assistance you said I'm coming from University of Pennsylvania and I'm really excited to work with many of you there's a quick outline for our took our first give a brief outline about work the assistive robotics manipulation lab plants to do animal follow into work that will actually talk about from work they did Manchester robots actually work with human collaborators to carry Optics including environment look at how robots can work with a first responders to actually anticipate what they're trying to do so you don't have to have a lot of explicit communication so how can they enable an amplifier with over their goals attacks are tell me when it actually improve the overall ability of his robotic assistance to manipulate things in their environment and to do this we have to improve their ability to be dexterous I can broadly be classified as how you can actually improve robotic assist even beyond this will begin to think about intelligent whereabouts cinema how can you actually improve prosthetic legs without having very invoice so that you know the robot understand what's going on in the environment anticipate with the human users trying to do I'm going to talk about what I previously done in the terms of a wetlab robotic assist the tax of robotic precision pouring as well as the initial efforts toward a co-operative transport in the 80s and 90s there was a lot of automation so you have in these very powerful robots able to do repetitive tasks and that's very effective in the manufacturing stand for in the 2080 the emergence of understand the environment in their place in it see all the embarking on really augmentation so robots are able to not only do tasks well and understand the control problem and then on top of that understands the environmental replacement for then happening also work with humour I need to collaborate a complex task Alex and liberation Labrador does problem of how the robots and understand people and the environment in the complex tasks that they are asked to do so in order to do this you can imagine you have to be able to perceive the human environment you need to be able to take actions that interact with resume the task in the environment and take action my invite models the interplay between what you respect human to do you expect the task to process or chain Batman relays that will allow you to achieve your overall desired outcome reading about really the sky are we have a back assistance with the goal is to enable and amplify the address of human collaborators so you know understand what they're trying to do and if they're doing never happened you a system to help them reach their goal and then even parallel to that how can you perform complex service tasks 4th connected devices you can imagine a having things that don't have actually soon like your phone in a smart Home devices like that and how can use devices understand what the human uses trying to do in it can you do an order for two weeks ago so imagine you have the walking into a building and you have a low mobility if you have a smartphone and understands you know your limitations can you talk with the building so that the door understands that you will need particular need to a dissipation for this is coming theme can you tell me whereabouts would stay in between you know the human in the world so that you can actually perform some task maybe it's a wheelchair me this arm prosthetic arm but how can it's actually understand what the human is trying to do understand the task in order to enable them to perform therapeutic phone is amazing people so far Heelys work she's looking into the human robot collaborative transport problem with the motivation robot assist in carrying an object in a colour in VI you don't have to tell your back trying to do that another human would analyse to achieve that goal problems we see in this space I really how do you actually extract this in 10 Peter how to use those things together at Brit where you need to go and then if you actually think about this you actually trying to model that human and this is a very complex thing tomorrow so what form should such a model who was can we take from understanding the relationship between input and struck the appropriate model that allows us to do the maximum with the least amount of days I'm thinking about how she designed this model in order to achieve that outcome should we consider you know time history how can we actually construct this that we can be informed by the physics of the situation that's going on with me to improve the doctors manipulation so the idea here is you know ultimately want to have robots in Italy very small things and more importantly when your middle and something you want to have a notion of how good you're doing as you're doing it so what's the stability of the grass what sensors are able to detect the failure mode so if you have a contact normal centre something slips out of your hand you know when it slips out but you don't necessarily always know when they all said that flipping is occurring so how can you assess the quality so there's some new sensors that are emerging in this interesting ideas on how to improve that's loose types of sense Billy's as well so we wanted to take those normal and shear forces in the soft finger to do this we want to mechanical engineering mechanics to give us a leg I want to actually understand the internal defamation fingertips are related back to the boundary for hopefully they have a very dangerous thing that gives us a lot of information we have a product with the goal here is to actually using a prosthetic arm what times it's really difficult there's a huge learning curve learning for some of these are kalidou sow very accurately can how to become skilled we have an on the table to perceive its decrease this morning Curve so that the person can operate this with a level skill much faster than completely control this system on some without it being informed about its environment and then how do you actually handle the input from the human to predict what is a trying to do and then even think about the Arctic senior environment what are there for dancers how should they be manipulated and how can that actually Govern the Way You Move two things that the human has an understanding of how you're moving and understand what your goal is to can be in unison as you're doing such really we're looking at this problem have you married the human might have some in Jesus how do you interact with the environment visual tactile measure and to make These Arms easier to use thinking why is modelling important for robotic tasks you know you have a car driving along and you know anything about the world you gonna learn from experience sometimes driver turning on cover from such a thing so sometimes it's really good to Marion violet if there is high risk in war what is the value of prediction so if you do have a model of your environment you can also beyond understanding safety you can't even understand how your actions will affect process where was going to occur and you can understand what you need to do in order to better reach your intended outcome fresheners what appropriate for Hampshire models take answers to this question analytical reduced-order models for Matalan equation you have non-parametric methods and processes known networks and then if you know absolutely nothing reinforcement learning we actually exploring the environment building such a mum misdirection tells you you know you won't you know that true underlying model that what's going on Direct help for a complex task you can be more time and computationally how these representations that you can level what does it mean for robots reason about a complex task give you a state space so this is a manifold and imagine that the state of the system is a position on observer training data like this imagine this this ball transfer moves on the discursive this is the physics of this system of this actually have observed data how the system change with these initial condition some current state which is actually cry when you have Uno data-driven approaches and you can really characterize the region that observed but sometimes if you haven't seen particular regions you can't say anything useful about analytical representations of reduced-order models you may be able to have some valid approximation within those regions that you know that representation is actually Val of this site why are these robotic assist if we take a look at all of the stuff for mailing was ok that's 0 and 4 actually want to have you can imagine if you can do these types of complex tasks for people can actually improve safety as well as convenience if you're able to do these things for them and actually augment their abilities train times if you saw some of these problems relaxing overlap well and different spaces assistant are you can imagine a lot of useful tasks being the ability to poor precisely the ability to carry in the lab space possibly like foxes our table replacing equipment maintaining cultures what the scientists are away focus on his first tutor nose and investigators problems and marlin control that we talked about before precision pouring do you know the state transition model here so here x is the he is your perception of the measurements the objective is to reach some targets and you're able to actually input you know or a process the state with some inputs you in the case of pouring the paradigm is imagine you have two containers and Europe or precisely but you have to pull the precise of man flu in this case modelling is extremely important because you don't have more than one chance to Paul looking at this the goals or can we pour using containers that are already found in the labs in our manufacturing can you pour precisely can you pork with if you want to minimise the tool change required Uno can you actually have a system that can interact with your normally see in the effective in that way instead of having something that has built into the arms images of you can actually help a scientist prepare to experience you can actually save a lot of time in there for money and I'm in if you're awesome little and very dangerous materials you can actually improve the safety for the library search the hardest problem video decomposing this we see that as she began to pour spillage with a problem fluid in the container was challenging station based on the food floor was challenging what is the pain in the time delay for the container was both challenging and shy I Robot extract additional challenges here is proceeding the container how can you see the container fluids inside of the container actually have a reduced order model for the flow dynamics will get two cases one where both container and one case where is not Known the junction is not know but approximate first case only observed the receiving containers volume girl the pouring container and monitor the receiving containers volume down the poor the first case of the fact that the geometry of the containers no no spelling occurred observable and the time delay for the small containers negligence the amount of time it takes to fall from the port container into the received appointment S for Balaton sound but the receiving container what Singapore container should be put in in order to achieve some desired volume and if you know the receiver Daltrey that can relate to the height inside of the receiver previous work that did similar things this work was done the idea was to say you know if we wanted to just poor for conventional use like you know drinking water for instance may be necessary to have extremely precise measurement of the fluid in the receipt this news case but we wanted ours to be more precise in this work they actually poor very precisely but was known about the pouring container and the next phase of the word relax that assumption and then in this work they have a very specialised roubaix remember this one is going to pop out into you know the given food into the container but if you actually want us to be very versatile and be able to transition to Karen something this setup is not good for transitioning to additional task first placidus we had this experimental setup we use the rethink Sawyer robot we manufacture our own container geometry which I'll explain what we chose the sheep in the moment and we observed the volume with a camera and the scale you see here was used for ground truthing and say that this had both the control and in a cool vision aspect the flow Dynamics here we used the following volumetric flow remodel so we have the fluid in the Beta container and this is going to be changing which you rotate the outside of the container and associated turned away right now hours or similar just attributed to the maritime it take for the fluid to exit the pouring at Tina and fall into the receiver and so you can break up the volume in the Porta Catania into the volume above the pouring turn the volume blow before alpha Blondy is the height of the fluid that 8 of the height of the fluid at the begin to Port Ford app warranty represent different of the base of the entertainers a rate of the kind of the container out of the fluid this is approximation for the volume of the pouring lip and the William below the port stop the 2DS or trams in you have an expression for the flow rate from the symbol equation for the fluid that exiting the poor and the fluid entering the receiver u01 on the fluid at the pouring lip if you have an expression for the geometry of the lip and expression for the area cross-sectional area of the fluid and you soon that h h rotary small in proximity with the flow the exit velocity of the fluid with the following equation from Brunel Way the geometry of the pouring container if we choose a square drama 34 simplicity we're all of these terms represent the different dimensions the the length of the lip the height of the floor above the height of the tyre container the length and width of the container then we can specify the as remission from Brewery integrating becomes this if you differentiate it it becomes this time we're here l is the length dimension and this 8-years the height of the fluid above the pouring lip if you look at the volume or below the container the function of the height of the container comes into play time to receive this term here this is the length of the container and width of the container then this can all be used to actually find our final Dynamics open take the original fluoride equation and we appreciate it once we have the depreciation of the flow rate and the change the acceleration of the volume inside of the receiving container the answer to this following Dynamics were these terms or substituted here and in terms of all the parameters that the geometry of this poor manistique better the things we care about as the height of the volume inside of the port container is derivative and the angle of the rotating port container does the name inside showed you on the previous line and represent them in this really nice form x that is good fxplus gym your ears as we had those terms in the previous life how old is the control the volume in the changing volume inside of the receiving container hence this output Matrix which is a function of r what is the fine distracting song trajectory volume inside of the receiving contain the question is how do you define such a structure in how you doing that allows you to actually meet your objectives so if you just say why you measure go you begin to poor you can easily overshoot so if you have a tree that your tracking and it's easier to not overshoot that target volume so we chose a fitwater polynomial that minimised jerk and there is supporting letter that says that can help with healing slashing as you're beginning Airport by choosing the nemesis we did in the applications that we have the output is feedback when your eyes will be next is full or rank in 4 g it's x control term and this is likely bracket with the pasadenas this is stable win these two conditions on the Statham Matt and that's to say that the height in the fluid of receiving container is changing are there for rising and your angle is not at the extreme points which axeman YouTube conditions are met then you are feedback on your controller to your object well we can represent our objective function in this fashion we want to minimise the air from that actually that were trying to try the sister pause the following hybrid controller so here because you said was feedback when your eyes will the idea here and reflect the screw and then you can send your objective function through as your target Behaviour when you're tracking a feed-forward term and then a PD controller on your area in history this feedback linearization policy for this hybrid state becomes this following Matrix which is stable in this case I should also mention that we had stability for this hybrid stay this following state initiate flow so if you're boring and the condition of the height is changing is not correct because maybe you over charger gold so you just after pouring then this one really supports that you get back into this hybrid state but we don't know it tells us if you're passed the extremum of your man inside of that you know that you put too much so there is fluid inside and it's not beginning before this one initiate poor and then we have the stability term and you are sleep between these two States where this procedure here and assist for we do this from a different volumes here 80 ml 120 for the results and then really show the statistics report this 100 x 10 seconds to reach warthog you can check out to see more about that so quick video stream this word turn on the fluid is blue so we can easily track it using online background subtraction you see here is k means clustering that helps detect between the fluid entering the container and which is coming down from the top in the fluid Rising is filtering lines we don't scan for the floor above that line so knows what I suppose indicator target value is this work we want to improve this we don't want to just pour from square containers fluid always be Blue song through the process play what we do as we have the set-up the other camera and now in this work we combine both Vision and await a scale to help us to text that vol inside of the receiving container and we have sold now that the receiving container is still a cylinder and we use a CNN to actually allow us to try arranging transparencies in colours by leveraging distortion or occlusion of a background music Alan filter to actually estimate the state at 30 Hz revision in weight of running respectively of 21 and 12 we've covered the case where both containers geometries and no one is not Known can we scan it an estimated or say something about precisely still in this case again we observed we can observe that we can observe the pouring a container that's what we want to do so now the question becomes can we estimate the Essential geometric characteristics in order to allow us to determine whether input which should poor in order to track the volume now we actually wanted for this system is remember we want this to be a very versatile setup is this state machine here so this describes an entire process going picking it up picking it up transferring pouring and placing it hardest part of this is definitely skinny McAteer charger you are very similar to the one we have before this is the volume in the receiver how it change accident and we have this T4 time volume in the container to the steady-state which is if you held the photo at a constant rate this blue should remain there in the red poor off the approximation that if we actually thinking more the steady-state transient corporate into the full-time with some time delay TV that's a function of the geometry of the container so we can have a more simplistic representation including this to the steady state of the volume inside of a pouring I just said the time delay is going to be a function of the geometry where this capital gamma is a term that represents this geometry and assuming that reporting from symmetric container so you just need to know the profile and one place to have to revolve that and have a job through the entire container is happened to find before we want a track some trajectory of the volume inside of the receiving container from the current volume that's inside again make of a portion of the active in this case that something to the diameter of the system the Kiosk materials Harry what's the relationship between the geometry and how you expect the volume to exit the pouring container sing about the steady-state volume inside of the port container if I hold it at a particular angle is a maximum amount of fluid that could be inside of a container at that particular your container is almost convex ok give me a weird geometry like a spiral container this might not be true before around to the complex container for particular angle does a maximum of fluid that can be in that so this cruises a one-dimensional volume maximum volume vs Engel Curve and if you pour from mini containers you can see that they each had their own could have you meet her which is a function of their John there was some relation here turn the steady-state assumption that if I can have this Curve the state care for the poor in container because that was causing the food as it then in the dynamic problem I can say that the change in volume and particular in the receiver will be the equal and opposite Force to review This is the first in the same fashion if you would have moved in a steady-state way understanding for symmetric containers the similarity assumption so we defined the serametrix of the geometry side if I have all the height of the container H1 and H2 and a private recess going from 0 to 1 base 2 take the difference between the consecutive from S21 I can and I swear this I can make this error function is really useful for comparison for the comparison between the similarity of multiple times play some Chinese as these Argos 20 these maximum volume curves also would then scanner containers Jama symmetric mechanics free function which is again or vs radius function Castle simulator this sort of container use the software in video the fluid are we actually improved please to the water so we can see how we expect that maximum volume for single curved to act if you have a new container if you from hundreds of these different ones that simulation you can see how close these geometries are and you can make an assertion about the similarity in those maximum rrr control diagram looks like this when we have some input vol project that was trying to try which is a function of the air all the geometry that maximum volume Curve as we mentioned in a fluid dynamics and some associate and away so we have to do some MPC here without puts your observed volume and the angle of the poor and we'll try to approximate in roof time what this maximum value per visit the way it is I want to do as we want to realise ok you know it's really hard you know to do this specially if you're pouring this container from the very first time we use a combination of two all lights to identification so if you have a parametric function can you approximate the poor is model price from simulation can you actually leverage these as well and so were really sit at the intersection of both the analytical reduced-order model as well as more of the non-parametric methods and we make the cimaconnect record for the parametric case for the lysosome identification you're pouring and support you observed that maximum volume vs angle Curve right and you can use power series paranormal to represent that curvature beginning to pause do this we actually optimise using this following objective functional components to hear is it says I should be in the poor you observed the different volume Max volume vs Angela should be getting to pork as you're feeling this you can try and minimise residual from the paranormal at those points achieved light future point of view one uses for prediction you don't want this to diverge even though it locally observe see what a regulator turn this is the coefficient skip two big keep the reason about they don't you know they're not useless beyond where I've already observe actually have a term that actually allows the system to respect the fizz vector derivative if you use control points the drilling well control 0 in the future so as you're pouring vol will never decrease the lol inside of the receiving wire for thinking about how we can actually learn from in the past washing process for their non-parametric kernel functions in the school of boxing really just says if I have a dealer piece of David I've seen before in a new piece of data how close are they how much can I rely on that previous data to tell me about the new piece of data that I've seen is using the discussion with white noise inside and this function here which tells you how much spread it time is a function of the edge hair of the geometry so if the distance between the points are very large and its correlates to what your expected behaviour would be for those different containers are particularly discount function we can actually can strap these convenience matrices that allow us to have a motion for how the training data associated with each other and how the interview for associate with a new task point that we were inserted into the sister this allows us to create the information mate is the training cave and this is a small constant of the identity in this is the information this is training in one shot if you have all of this datastore this is your train model the non-parametric estimates then uses the the test areas with information gain and the new data points we observed two then extract what are training data to extract what we maximum volume at work wearing combining things the all-nighter some identification and has got a process we can put them together to make this entire summer permit what that maximum volume for will be at particular parametric form is the power series representing the poor this is a mixture possibility saying if your through the top 10 containers and simulation of a close how close were you to that container and you can use that error function for geometry to give you that Mr possibility where the second son's 21u have that Tesco grounds for this container vs all the training containers has tripped and training containers information mate how old is an expression you can get the Best of Both Worlds and that's why I put you in the next flight what's the time the way again we had estimate this because your significant time delay for how exit the poor and fall into the receiver again if you take captain containers that are closest to your geometry and you researched that the relationship between the input the angle and the juncture of the container is a smooth and continuous taxi make this model approximation very well saying if I if I understand my geometry given all the test cases if my container is closer similar to one in my training play are geometry through the CNN add this to my photo and my input to expect my time delay to be and we found a disc enough for us to be able to control the system predictive control in this regard has a few more hybrid in Gard States you know you have that multiple says what are the transition support go to that this one is just to say if it is the end of within the limits this is to say is the volume in the receiver constantly increase this one says I does the volume profile for the maths one curved does that respect the physics as well and then is the volume actually increase is the error function for the trajectory that you're trying to track parcel I have a very similar Highbury controlla ware gang this is a positive gain and allows you to rotate in poor the process fluid and initiates flow in when you're in this day going to talk about the stability region that I like it actually track with her or trajectory you're trying to Port undesired volume in the receiver we have our current volume write we can explain this in terms of integrating from over past actions till now how to minimise this Air from this life on off function here for stability become if the desire to get arrears not change forecast you haven't passed that obvious conditions for stability of this is true and if you saw the surface just means that your KP is passed you're to get to your changing then you have work the trying to catch the missile problem mate because the escape velocity so you're you need a KP that allows this condition if this is not satisfied then hopefully your trajectory generator will pause cause you got into far away and you'll be back to this condition as long as you keep us positive you'll catch up final volume is inside of your you can use a simple are trajectory travel to directory to light up or what's interesting about the letter that we decided in our paper was to say can you actually change this trajectory generation based on how well your approximation is doing a really bad job don't work quickly but if you know that you're doing a really good job of estimating the geometry of the container that you can be more aggressive Bishop or and I help you meet your thing which is the poorest quickly as possible as you can see here so for this particular container for this number of trial with this demonstrates 41k tell you the volume in ml 100 115 200ml targets as a matter of time that it took if you're not familiar with this graph form this is a box but this show you on the side of the violin plot shows the distribution of the data also for the three points that distribution is in addition to the statistics of irregular past visa for the parametric method which is just using the fitting of the curve of the power series Kirk this is the non-parametric just forgotten process and this is the combined method that we saw so one day I want to bring to light as you noticed that the majority of the data is really between can be interpolated between the parametric and non-parametric this is really important for me now I'll see you in a sec how many different containers again you can see of 100 million ml how again this my permits before between these two some of these cases and it's cleared that one of the methods that the parametric seems to be Out Performing both others so why not picking in the in the frame of if you had a portable system that we never got to touch again if you wanted to choose and commit to on a particular path what's the best one I will always atomise come so if I have a container from all of the example containers hours in before 4 the Premiership orange really bad but still I had this interpolated behave is the non-parametric did well if you had dinner but then when you don't have data it can perform that's the both were is by using a combination of them in the summer chromatic method that's informed about the quality of both goes on to say if you look at those maximum volume these were the prizes that were built for the angle vs Valium and if you zoom in for the the power series generation how quickly converged to containers of 13 different containers each one 10 times and we have two metrics to compare here we have the air vs the height of the container and we have the time it up the poor vs the height of a cat interesting to note here is the fact that as you'd expect if you have what we did was we we did put a lower bound on the lower rate which you could rotate your containers as you're pouring if you have a container the angle that you pass through will actually be a lot larger and so you'd acting up or slower for very very long containers because this has that adverse effect we had that lower limits are you slowly see the sink places you know but that is actually and sort out with them given that Laurel limiting allowed to go slower after larger containers if that's what you want to do outline here just take that and that time and put into a single distribution of data were here again as the tallest container on in this is the smaller containers agency that distribution if you compare it to the most similar work in the state-of-the-art for we have similar x with higher precision front use case for applying for the pharmaceutical space quickly or demonstrates the operation situation so here you would go down in skin the container geometry struct the symmetric boundary had simulated the pores and the effects we did this from many different containers the top 10 that are closest to The Jam tribute container turn time after you scared basque the Red Lion is the target line this is the Apple from the CNN detecting the volume inside the net volume here again is the common fault of population of the end do you have a hydrocele in point of jetro Unity import battery vol here and there goes to Port to 100ml liquid do a decent job comparison would be if you had a human join probable to Hollywood took this to the cookie animation award about 2 years ago this one was more focused on just the system identification site this video shows the entire pipeline dimension that full state machine going in grasping in other container and then using it support the process of manifold again the takeaway is here now or if you can actually have some knowledge about the physics of what you're trying to do really great naked help you in the model construction what your cistern to be adaptive so what's the best modelling techniques you can do to allow it to be effective in a real-world scenario Squires the controller goes you can then given the appropriate modelbuilder stable controller and one that accommodate the different modes that your system take English now to the problem we want to see ok what lessons can we learn how come you're probably similar things to this space you know we have the status tomorrow as soon you have a human wants to go from point don't want to tell you this also magic big flat screen TV for your living room you don't want to bring it can a robot you know work with you to help Cerys 60-inch TV can you work on the perception size so how can the robot observe the human observed the environment modelling clay motion of and understand the combined system motion and then what control input should you do on based on this information to achieve your play watch these movers Kerry the Nutcracker a really decent job is summer colour environment working together to transport this and only bring it once past exam go back to do how can we do this functions are laissez-faire what does problem a son you know where you want to we want to take the combined play Collide with afterglow as well as conserving energy during the transfer Ryan optimal transport as being down from closer to by love what inclusion with obstacles and conserving energy inclusion by first if you know where we're going establishing the freespace region we should reverse to get motionhouse all agents Michael and agree on such trajectories even on a local Horizon after trying to move in the common turkey Direct we have to work that allows us to characterize their free space so if you use the sample based method like our t-connector you know find a sample pack from your start to your goal you can learn optimise that but then taking those cores constructing the free space region and then you can actually love your system to traverse in that free space optimizing whatever metric you had such as distance or time or turkey whatever if you compare this to some of the complaining of a mathematics free space of a day out with an expense ellipsoids to maximise that free little bit different because we just care about actually traversing that's Christmas we don't need extra model all of the possible for you you know I'm not needed understand everything about the other horse I just care about the reason that I'm going to do competition between the hours on the Liverpool there's show me energy if you're trying to move an object the forces along the connecting lines called the interaction forces between two points art contribute to the motion so stress or strain Chinese lines and then motion in needs of United Dragons coronavirus have the rent which is the force into work of art replying you can send the forces in ours there contact vector so this is the moment so this is the skew symmetric Matrix we can make this cold or contact matrix gr which is for each other's component action forces as I just mentioned or if you take to pairwise force as well as take the normal difference of the vector that connects them in project these along those vector is Greenland just here for your interactions set alarm work done in the 1980s and 90s really look that was to say if you wanted to make the interaction forces go to zero if all of your agents agreed on something or call a solution vector given their contact location of the all have consensus on mechanically requires of the interaction Force 0 and I work we actually looked on into this case and we can think about multiple robots working together to achieve that so if you're trying to if you know the past that you need to take in that free spacing you know what rent you need to move along to to move in that direction in the first thing you need to do is talk to other robots and say what is the factor solution better with that we should use and if we all agree on that then we can use this for Dynamics and we know that actually conserve energy vs the forces that were played on a system as we transport now if you wanted to work with a human I'll be able to digitally communicate with them and share consensus back so how do you do this case we assume that the human hasn't endigo but this call may be unknown to the robot some work in a space but a lot of the time this work requires that the rubber seals some interaction Force in order to know that is she moving in particular ways Simply Red on top of that all the technical challenge the existing and reaching to this point we have adapted to the system down distributions and then planning in his instruction environment so what I'm going to talk about now is how can you observe the human in the environment and planning the system to go thinking use a controller on top of that to reach your target or location thinking about this is extremely hard problem how do you actually matter the human in terms of everything that you can observe it's not real what is the notion of how does this relate to the Dynamics of the system like you know the rent the forces in the tour observe and then how can you even think about how the system will actually rotator change as a function of watching the person the head is looking at the velocity of the system in order to predict that motion realise that is extremely hard to model so what we assumed was that if we watched humans do this we can imagine that the human was the expert and made with the Transport that model from the humour the robe these are measurable quantities you can see your environment you can see the person's head you can feel forces apply here what's the piece of person's feed as well as the notice the systems velocity as you're moving along Santa they had the ability to see the person's face emotional forces watch the person's feed and use motion capture extractor pose in glass with a robot and then we walked in this space so I was trying to just silently predictor I wanted to go and do the decent job don't want too many Force we did this out of 6-months from just walked around this location location and then you have to transport efficient part of this really said ok you know if we are really want to take a notion of what things should be related like the head in the September needed to velocity and acceleration how should things be combined in an intelligent way to reach for the best outcome for predicting a future pose at th timer editions of this structure we came down to this and if you expand it this is the truth form that this new network architecture what was the estimated opos planet collision future doctrine that this piece does and then you want to control on a trajectory using a method that we discussed before with the network that we describe this was the outfit that we received four different look ahead x 2 s 1 s .5 seconds in 1.5 seconds so bold and for the shortest time Horizon are error in predicting on the hold-up set for the two humans carrying was on the order of 10 cm and 10 cm and the prediction of the angular rotation we were about 10 degrees we're Sunday Markov processes you need to observe what's happening at this instant to predict that time Horizon ahead of time and so by changing the time Horizon the data size chain outputting perform Horizons in the different area and angles within without the filter and what you'll see is if your time Horizon is less you're more accurate but if you can give yourself more time to to predict that you can actually do more things like planning control and do other things competition inside of the time just using the last e as an instantaneous predictor of we're going to be on his look at her time for all of our data the difference in their performance on the holdouts for you know the angle in degrees video of show this position is where my feet is that you can see the reference frames for the articles being carried the red is where we've been in the purple is predicting the system predicting on that time Horizon where will go with because 1.5 seconds and this is the local map in the body fixed frame of the sun this video here quickly shows we begin to wanting to know is this is a comparative useless with a bit of walking around here so it may look like you're as well this is just an artefact of the bird's-eye view little bit of work from the chemist inside this is the typing this is bottom so there's a height difference what I really want to emphasize the fact of your speed this up you can see that we do a really good job of predicting where you want to go so common question is what calories in one of these predictions put you in a war but if it does again this was a planning component you can then have a controller on the lower level which then says is this is actually feasible should I actually try to achieve that configuration we going to transpose that to a robe just a geometric description of the controller that you have to carry this as a grass constraint you can rotate more than 90 degrees if you're holding is facing the human so this needs to be a part of it but if you can play and where you believe that you would go you can actually use this as a feed-forward charm and then use compliance as your feedback term so like you to walk with the human hopefully conserving energy Rathmore trains a problem with the DM human 10 depose which allows us to estimate where the human wants to go aap supporter jetray in the freezer how to move in that direction if we know where are our collaborators are grasping the sister systems we really looked at the ability to port from containers adapt to new container we didn't require a lot of augmentation around carrying able to after from optimal transport pause the system now allows to painkillers and projector I'm in work and want to go who is how can we extend these notions to other human-robot collaboration case varying perhaps emotion working with rehabilitation in helping first responder in summary we have a lot of interesting collaborators in research again that we've covered just one phase of what the arm lab hopes to Taco but really you want to look at how can you know these robot understand the people that working with and understand their role x using this would you change yourself to the city of the fluid changed how to change the set Romania Max volume you can imagine would remain car stickers if you hold it there at the trains in time would ultimate will be effective Hollywood so that time the way that you expect for the for the transpose we actually used machine learning based on the Nvidia flex modelling the approximate all of those time so I loved reduced-order analytical methods but as you know like the navier-stokes doesn't have a closed for actually use NIV effects to have a good approximation of what we expect that's great so I would tell you that they would be going to NVIDIA flex tune for that include imagine having multiple models and having a system that allows you to spend that space depending on what you're observing in terms of how fast something is boring turn the lights on you can take and how could we describe it so you should take my listen to talk really if you think about your state space and you can the notability essentially whatever controller you want you want that final region to be a stable region that she'll stay inside off taxi augmenting that final state manifold that you want to actually show produces stability really produces level sets around that's to be the reason that you have which is why a lot of times it looks like energy because level-set ability level set representation but when you go through the process the intuition is your thinking about level changes your manifold structure such that going into and that is the can you think about granular materials not just so that's a great question so I had 1-in 1 time ago were actually worked with tylenol and I can tell you why powders are crazy sometimes that you you're poor there like Sheeran if it's not raining that I argue that it might be possible to approximate that similar to how you expect fluid to behave if your particles are really big than you may even want to think about like the actual Dynamics how interactive The Courteeners again somewhere to his question you can totally imagine if you use some simulation software to make the basis for your model you can increase the size of particles in that space you understand what the expected behaviour was interactions with a container or learning to actually validate the video model in the first place but you know you'll be totally imagine ring such a thing so if you think about like you know for deployment promises if I didn't product I would say you were told you want to just have something that automatically went through the Range to give you that range of in that you drinking your data so that you could have that reason to assemble Victoria imagined doing experiments as well you just won't be able to do as many but they will be possibly more accurate than you'll have to consider the container space as well because there was an entire metaphors itself hello play Maestro change side on Spotify that kind of thing human emotion vs machine how would I do like your career you know our objective is to say can we insert these robots into human basic Farm operate as closely to people as as we can and give them the tools to do extremely small problem that is not a free 4.0 l'absolu need YouTube you know is it possible to actually have an example with the robot be able to manipulate the price that exists and is only used by humans as opposed to one that needs to all men finally trying to give her fingers Xterra the world that exist dog meant for question about how would you be able to estimate for the thermostat you don't necessarily know what the actual container is that also in between that was the same you know I like you questions really good at site I was making the assertion that as I scare my container jamat the wall is almost infinitely thin a large like a thermos case that might be a very poor approximation in the current setup then you have to definitely rely more on the system identification Micro Magic is this expect it to write and if you see that divergence you need to identify interesting perception side of the pram that you've made very interesting you know system identification side as well you know I'm moving forward you know you want to try that address both but that next collaboration on this not like what's the weather like when was Pitch tiles like 3 years ago they were saying how to spend a lot of time actually just boring these mixtures in order to test this on a small rapid research scale from now on this particular boring task to speed up their time measure the weight of when you're pouring will it work the question is Uno can you think about the mass of a container that your hole forth and the areas you could take that more information is always better I think they were particularly help me with my full-time because the master change 124 l got it so you can just remove that full-time from the time you know if I hold this container you know it's transition of the the fluid won't register as a change of mass in 2 l Tina's way too far and the Tennessee the mastin change but if you stop there that angle you would have drastic effects of the fluid you know falling down below the the mass holding the massive container only really help seems to help you full time involved in there maybe could say you know how does the shifting of the container work this is an entire new projection of the geometry model and if you had that in the first
