thanks for the introduction my name is Sandeep I'm a PhD student code by searching padian Marconi they'll be discussing distributed perception and learning between robots in the Cloud which token resource-constrained robot that has no power drones computing services to improve their computer vision caf performance to see sweets and network robots pizza robot trains from low power delivery drones how much larger self-driving network robots are trying to Face to couple challenges Mr measure ingrowing vol 2 very rich thanks retailer the top left of the screen an example of a lighter point cloud which is used to localise different objects of Interest during navigation autonomous vehicles also have several HD cameras to do video streaming and object detection and television tax example actually from Stanford on my AC video is used to do action and computer vision test automatic segmentation can Costa different objects of Interest that share same label or category what is very rich sensory stream and British point of the physical World from multiple different cameras 32 increasingly computer and power-hungry model computer vision they might use deep neural networks and in the art of deep learning is people are trying to very large models with several layers slow for inference but also computer hungry but very active my thesis Focuses on network connectivity can actually help robot this example of a fleet of low power drills very rich and sweet potato deal with the sensory data they may have a local normal robot computer vision this could be an object detection model called mobilenet at 3 computing power efficient to run run in your smartphone quicksand the most accurate so suppose this Joan is normally on study fencing class send or what's called upload this image of interest to the cloud could be a group of Central servers or connected by an edge computing server turn back by g network we could actually have very good wearing models that are computer intense and there in the Cloud you can access precomputed maps for databases so Google Images use human annotation services for asthma benefit of network connectivity in robot real-time inference results for computer vision the first half of this top Selby a distributed inference problem turn a different class on my timers CB computer or power live very good bulky gp14 network connectivity can actually help them for that comes in the form of better specialised models send interesting field data to the cloud retrain models and adapt them to a robot real-time offering commission estimated that future self-driving cars 4 TB a very rich sensory data in just an hour and a half the fraction of this was sent to the cloud models and improve computer vision tasks report problem of distributed learning will be the second half of this time Alice here is your using very precious system resource from congested network transfer up to human annotation time cloud storage this across several different robots in this week Challenger field robotics comes with some key challenges that are typically understated today problem of distributed inference in real-time between say a low-power drone and a cloud computing server um2 actually quite into it sometime for network communication problem of network latency coupled with the slow inference time of using a large additional that's it in the club the second problem of descriptive learn there's a lot of data about 4 TB per one-and-a-half hours fraction of this was sent to the cloud from every robot so every time it takes some time to upload it take some time to annotate interesting examples add to Cloud storage cost train models are end-to-end or holistic systems course well midday volume up my research is to limit communication collectively what traditionally queried the cloud benefits of cloud computing in robotics but with minimal and mention the first half of this talk will be on a problem of distributed in 4 computer vision between a robot and the cloud offloading can you make it a bit more what's the speed of drones anomalous in oven I've actually computing detection using Google Edge tpu or tensor processing unit dedicated pixl raita running in the USB stick that's very fast and computer Vision and severe Newport s you can look lies the major object in the scene which is a human you can see the many different objects of Interest are totally missed by the shallow mod you can quit the clown if you answered same image you see many more detection for Roger increase time delay I've actually clearing us cloud computing server time contribution of our work is this offloading logic concise and small neural network is running on a drone very timestep weather in robot should yousefi local model incident and really needs the accuracy benefits of cloud computing this took I'll actually build a pond distributed in subway what are always sending uncertain images to the cloud use them to retrain computer vision model perform problem distributed learning interesting training data from Robot actors example again very interesting data during the course of a day pictures from my commute to Santa Macy a very well understood safely YC come across a new construction site with dynamic obstacles and roadblocks so this is actually Macy a novel visual Concepts that maybe your neural networks don't Solutions with store all this data on board robot overrun storage on very small resource-constrained robots and quite I'm uploading this over the network a terabyte size dataset that's growing daily benefaction of time untimely when using a fraction of this data retrain a model which takes cloud computing resources processes you can think back the robe Warminster in the next field test for example build a lightweight sampling algorithm that actually very similar to the offer it's sitting on a resource-constrained robot maybe you should filter out that someone boring well understood training data interesting trading data still get the benefits of retraining a model but with minimal end-to-end systems the Ned trading in Cloud computing problem of intelligence Sam I can give an outline for my talk start with a motivation about using cloud computing and robotics text abusing a sleeping on that switch to a physical Plusnet streaming this high bit rates and three-day that to the club strategies to promise that build upon each other end with future directions in network question of Interest is what is the accuracy gap between a robot model in the Cloud model is there actually some benefit of actually using cloud computing and reporting this question we should understand some very recent trends in it in and hey you see a video that's been processed by the Google edge10 surpassing you wait USB stick and it's running at 70 frames per second couple years ago I'll be stuck with this generic arm CPU order 92 store play the capability of embedded AI for these low-power drones is becoming faster cheaper and more powerful prince latency is not the only figure of Mary what you care about is the relative accuracy gap between a robot model and a card model show this picture before what is cloud vocalise for objects much better the price of very large data set is actually a fundamental trade-off in the size of a neural network so how many layers and parameters network has with the inference time so how slow it is inference latency metric here Dior the mean average precision sing how close is a bounding box to the ground truth should I get the label correct ACS cloudray models which are the bottom row paramount enlarger and slower but double the actor actually I can only trailer I have the money for just to Cloud reviews running 1 in your future cell Tower the money for the other GPU I'll actually provision 10 lightweight drones with HD view bike competitions robots in peace model which should have the Best of Both Worlds algorithm to make this more clear to actually from my dash Cam and Michael the dish there's a very large construction site for over 6-months at Stanford and I collected quite a lot of data are end of this video or towards the end you actually see an excavator or a tractor the computer fishing model which is mobile no 9 seconds longer to look like this chapter because it needs to get very close can you see that a cloud rain model can see it from what solution would actually interleaved blood computer clouds over and say hey for off tractor beware efficiently on watch this video realises hey indeed there's an excavator right panel with a very stable bounding box you will place this using work computer machinery Mart actually have the Best of Both Worlds algorithm the top I've actually motivated there's actually some benefit of using cloud computing in your body using ADP cost of getting to the experimentally quantify discourse possibly in Toulouse so that we always have very congested while listening video streaming while on the move dig deeper directions more nuanced reasons network today are built asymmetric capacity to stream to The Cloud so ugly download which we typically do today it's actually quite interesting video streaming protocols are fundamentally designed for human the downstream consumer is a human eye we reconstruct every single picture on the scene world were most video that I can send over the internet is never watched by the human eye or your eye but actually by a GP no network or robot you can actually crop out or automatically learn what are the stallion part of an image but get the same sent in pascal interesting this problem we have a very small vision paper in the networking community about call networks meeting physical or wireless set a test this problem of streaming to the cloud modality of interest in robotics which is lighter simple example homer at Centre moms are from Marcos class are they have several robots and many students have for streaming data from Bella downlight are sensors to a central server Lydia is you have a light or sensor and an embedded GPU extremely large point clouds to a central server to do computation question is how well can you do this using today's default autonomy stacking robotics which is send a lighter point clouds to a server they're actually fairly large they come at 70 MB per sec Channel by today's Wi-Fi taxi Penzance source in blue as expected you're sending steadily at 70 MB per sec play an actually increased congestion on the network from right to left puzzling results purple that if you just sent from two robots simultaneously that seems less than half the day that use intended Bruce by if you look carefully Bros was built-in very someone antiquated Python code for at least this part high-performance networking streaming so good fix that video which are shown on the previous slide establish standards for compression and streaming of light are streams can several years to build a centre it actually took several years and Industry to do this suppose is the best simple algorithmic solution learn to be intelligent about what computation you do on a roll the cloud world's but with limited network bandwidth from this not talked about much in robotics but actually practitioners online effacing I'm motivated the benefits of using cloud computing but because it's actually built this influence Park real-time computer vision is how robot can seamlessly integrate with local and cloud pumpkin contribution about work is to view cloud offloading model selection under answer you can build this offloading no network that's sitting on a robots in bed it's you every time set whether it should use a fast response of local compute model enisa cloud actually that is offloading your network is 18 times smaller than even mobilenet here for real timing and how are you can mathematical keratosis problem you are offloading as a problem of sequential model selection and actually an optimal control problem under and simple example face recognition from play the goal is I want to look like every single human face here and say who the person a new frame of video I may want to use my normal robot model very next frame of video there's a lot of temporal coherence for those faces for persist drain power about model once again past predictions that have saving mem video continuous if I see someone told me you then maybe I want to create a cloud actually come to the fundamental constrained and a limit has a fair share they can only clear the clouds a 5% of the time budget but also uncertainty about what the robot will see in the future and needs to be smart about whether I should really create a club the bandwidth utilisation across the fleet what are the decision-making process is a choosing optimal action what is the right model to use currently what's real-time uncertainty and operating do you want to use pass prediction which are very fast potentially still however I may want to clear the robot model with this joints and power but it's more accurate finally highly uncertain I really want to create the cloud with this documents my budget by 1 room to create a car in the future when I might be really answered facing this problem the right option to choose that every time it's much more precise mathematically on the next side intuitive I want to know how much is a sensory input change yeah I'm showing a difference between two successive frames of video that's why it's black does not changing much I may want to use past predictions but I could be old I want to create a cloud I need to know what budget remains and how much time do I have to add this decision-making procedure is you want to maximize accurate same time in Mazda car Queen is different it's very hard to model the Dynamics and a wireless network robot will see in the future so how the video evolved learning methods for control specifically deep reinforcement learning budgetary constraint that the limited queries to the cloud robot traditionally this learning-based approach many of you are familiar with deep reinforcement learning I'll give a very simple example you have an agent which is our offloading policy is a neural network that sitting on the robots GPO sensory status ft this is to guide what is the Right Action fdj is the actions are what are the right models to use at a given time point to control this answer in environmental Dynamics are not unknown in Italy through interaction in childcare you want to optimise you want to maximize sysctl performance measure word art using or on this problem RL works quite well and problems were there station vs exploitation trade off parents does prom my own robot competition as much as possible don't want to miss out on what the card will tell were cloud-based results model that I can learn that through interaction and learning during the training is again it's very hard to model that the Dynamics of assist play swing but also of the video just point I show how I can do this offloading policy which is an Oral agent I'm smaller than mobilenet sometime some state SSG action space ideally past robotic lock prediction retrain mobilenet turn Creative Cloud human decision-making procedure using a reward phone accuracy with infants later sup as a Markov decision process or an MBP more control Estate rewards and portion of Interest is what are the robot and Proud model shoes separate separate and modular robotic car models that don't necessarily need to be on your own machine learning models with the different trade-off between model complexity new image Exeter setup bounding boxes are predictions and confer modularity is actually quite clear play the network Time set I can always default to local computer what's to have general machine learning Paradise play the action space before it's actually quite into it ranges from simple past prediction maquina cloud having 4 days to sync actions small offloading ronet that real-time on hardware you can stick to local computer question is Jimmy's Robin card model you're out with the right one interstates decision-making procedure microsemi complex equation but actually there only for underline concept elevators I need to know how much has a visual input changed over time the difference between two frames of video people difference and it most of the background is black like I should before naproxen for dynamis does not changing much then I want to ideally use pass predictions by need to store my elementor what do stored or pass probation stay do I need to know what the past predictions where I need to know how old are still you could be timeline components finally if I'm highly uncertain and I want to create a cloud I need to know what budget remains and how long I have to allocate what is the right use of cloud computing at a given operating hear the state-space doesn't actually speak into a new frame of video that's actually delegated to the street Ranger on it a very small state and action space concise oral agent that can be run in hardware with minimal over goal of this decision-making procedure what's the actor time in my systems cost what are the systems rigorously defined them from operating conditions in your own pattern table before that trades off influence time of the year on at play roughly if I'm Queen the cloud baby due to the round trip time the floor entrance time action 3 of playing the cloud simple memory race across Paris set up to 7DP what texting move into hardware experiments on a actual path the general algorithm but we tested it out on streaming face recognition from video a bunch of synthetic videos millions of them in fact by splicing together different faces of in Raj and fine-tune it on real videos how might this go for sometime there some coherent pattern may see someone new the robot model use Face then it's a defacto on your own that for face recognition is present in all iPhones you're highly uncertain only then would you create it agent in simulation on an actual platform and deploy on your video Peter our experimental results we are real agent in blue is running on an NVIDIA GPU episode 1 of 500 test episode take care for this problem maximize my route I want to maximise accuracy axis time minimise systems cost which is on your ex green EC in upper bound salute robot if you perfectly knew what the crowd would say in the future there's no answer agents quite cold today only if it's by over 2 x benchmarks in grey that you would use a robot you might say I don't care about cloud computing and robotics so I would but it very loudly maybe I want to create the cloud but I'll think of a simple heuristic I don't care about all that I'm less than 60% confident on the robot local computation and find the optimal pressure actually doesn't explain a key property of video that there's temporal coherence so I can leverage past predict lights on he could say I really want to create a cloud budget of 10% of 8 play the card 10% of 8 name of that server and just keep past predictions intermediate you get this tiles much better because it's Intel judiciously pack enquiry uncertainty play interleaves better for local computation in red education in yellow semen small robotic platform but it's only work quite well pakora if you want more details on this you can see your paper with a lot of markers students at James Arthur point of which tracks and actually go much faster very simple problem on distributed learning build upon real-time computer vision which was the first already answered interesting images to the cloud the exploit those to retrain a model so medigate this uncertainty early into a lit that learning rare events can actually improve your decision making models and reply no that isn't a proper construction site maybe I can think about robotic ways we are upstairs updates HD maps for singles this to the Robots a new novel visual event that I should maybe retrain mind inside of our work today's robot but hazard collectors a training day what of work on active perception and robotics where should a robot move next to maximise information free eye tests and I've onto your switch we actually do at 7 maybe have no control about where the person is driving play see something you may be it every Tesla sent 1% of interesting images of salt per day interesting visual information just 1% intelligent sound play upload is charging at night store how much inat in recompute end-to-end system spot on how many other examples where this may be used robot network is actually a big play prioritise interesting field the talk I'll actually Mary the first half quite similar benefit of using a cloud do I actually need to use the cloud to specialises more what cost does a car this sampling watch that gives you the benefits of both with minimal question of Interest why should I even specialise computer vision model computer computer vision models not good enough this is a picture from my commute hear this runthrough.co.uk coco pretrained models I downloaded from Google the common objects in Context vocabulary recognise your everything from a toothbrush to an app no what a traffic cone steak and positive person does excavator here is neither like a bus or a car so sorry Miss retrain model this marcasite so if you watch this video model on the left make the mistake in calls every single traffic cone present a person retrain model is more domain-specific what you actually correct solitaire reason why want to retrain models is that the real world is constantly changing and I want robots to crowdsourcing excavating the road digging up the soil real-time model drifter you can see right panel within a couple weeks totally different truck pulling in the road using is asphalt compactor naturally humans can you also see various interesting ask my Google and I'll see a waymo car connect today can recognise waymo cars for light are you that you can do model change the time in the world war carbine highway 85 or see yet another startup this is the rules changing can we not have robots reflector different applications for Warwick waves benefit in reaching our computer vision models they come what is actually annotate small dataset from my own dash cam computationally they're over 2000 image why don't I just randomly select 1% of the State what is still very expensive to label Google Cloud labelling service do this who is just too much for us to One image that Google labelled for me and has over £20 in box numbers at this rate this is exorbitant fused research budget but if you do this this car is several hundreds of thousands or even millions and 20 startup therapy singer switch on in2itive in robotic you can actually do this I'm free credits for about $400 by automatically sampling but is Hamid I actually do idea or of Interest is that you may actually need very few or on the y-axis is a final accuracy of a machine learning model how much data did I use what you can see if there's a kilo of diminishing returns Derek visual concert that is maybe to learn what the way my car is I just need 10% of data time the marginal gains and accuracy by the high systems cost of going out into the field and Aquarius show the four for these dynamic targets which are constantly changing maybe you need quite a lot of data like a construction think of examples of robots crowdsource in an automated way question of Interest is given that perhaps I only need 10% of Visual data America is like this sitting on border drone video here is I can use transfer appreciate your own app from Google nice toothbrushes and such to learn new class samples of waymo cars or lighter vocabulary recognises new visual concepts I can build a data-driven filter this net is arm what is it called fine score for being away my car in on my way more cars that are actually more cars in red and say what is a confidence often is an empirical cut-off between background relevant cars or flowers for example build some proxy of maybe this will take away my play Sara compact visual descriptors players Avenue on that and often a few can see the distance between two flowers more than a flower in a car forever help me signal what is signal of interest from background noise here is you actually getting beddings and his confidence scores for free during in simple number crowd source select what did I care no confusing and I'll make it more clearer happens in days or rounds I maybe some human the cloud looks like this video on says no traffic cones so well maybe I need more pictures of construction site fleet of tesla's researching limited amount of these images to your course can you train a neural network mentored labelled that was a woman's heart that I can straight online let me send you on your net train on those two normally recognised I can build a filter signal in red from background noise please thresholds for the robe what is Task with a very simple and easy problem is New Year on that and a set of target images new video look like a Rainbow Car taken if sorted pasta depression save it onboard uploaded at the end of the day a human that looks at his filter samples network and sings it back to the robe over several days you might be quite uncertain about what do you actually care truma data and use feedback from a human in the loop you do much better feedback have time to go to the full paper when it's about this intelligent sampling logic that can actually fit on a USB directions NN2 volunteers Coldharbour Smith it's in orange trying to harvest interesting information start in this single one of these sampling schemes are extremely Cash live Claude 200 images random schemes that aren't so good but assistant is fairly well compared to an aura yeah here is by using feedback from a human and by adjusting me stress much better than an adaptive ski data that minimises your internet actually trying to build a cell Android simple home robotic Spotify what's called Federal rumours summer you can have an edge GPU running real-time inference and prioritising interesting picture from my home and you can see different models work very well for a bit and then they told me break apart on as a remote every room and every house contents 10% of interesting data privacy built on your own I can do that your own that that throws away any pictures of a human being Tesla DashCam data as well have a test and want to volunteer I'm almost done finish very quickly on teacher Direct this is the computer vision first for this large multi GPU and now it's just us when it is getting faster cheaper and more powerful why do I even care about cloud computing always have a roll you can call it or data from several robot had a time human labeling services you can retrain model you can use precomputed database B onboard your drone all it's really small USB intention about what I should do on your butt and watch I do in the Cloud how should we design video streaming if we know that what is video about maybe a gpro.net 7 I can send much less or there and get the same thing task accuracy by co-design present data four interesting a little bit more the Red Bull machine learning your son very simple preliminary results new image except aggressively for send over wirelessly turning off stop here and say I care about how good the reconstruction loss turn on TV I care about how good an images for downstream control push the loft on to the right the two you can see you can be very aggressive and compress much less severe very small examples from Emma very high compression getting better robots that are severely networking undersea darpa subterranean challenge maybe they can retrain models on device concept called federative learn because in federated learning leaked private data to a cloud retrain models on device with minimal NL promising network controller cost database when did how much data I send Julie has a network bandwidth utilisation what a start AT&T gets a lot of interesting network data control see my ass private forecast to take uber for example give me the scope in volume of how much did I share for cost a private maid of honour papers if you're interested you should have turn off space Audi budget is the robot has a budget of £800 in Creative Cloud 5% the time of 250 so the search I'm looking different wireless link condition tell agent on a wide variety of budgets and actually tested that's why I put had a distribution on return the weekend computing can help in what's called super-resolution so enhancing the quality of an image I was talking about was on the communication in a sensing task a lot of the background is irrelevant so that they want to automated licence plate detection maybe I don't care about background trees and decompress my chest but also store less on a cold sore resolution as you mention enhancing which has a raw this is for the communication Chinese state Media fortune 5G something I know that people are thinking about in China is like manufacturing is a limited commodity it's there tons of robots humans using Wi-Fi on the manufacturing for you may have small room I like things doing logistics we have a central until you're operate these robot a human has who has abstract bandwidth to create the robot machine-a protocols in five g250 just enhance everything
