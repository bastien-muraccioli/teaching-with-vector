an introduction is nice to be back will you be back cos I feel like I should be dislocating or something like I'm just doing work but actually just get to be here to help with you guys and chat so share with you a bit of research that I've done in the past and I was reading into some stuff that's new in the future and don't want to that other school across the bay the few places is going to grad school here and a few other places and volunteered at other places so I've had this sort of weird career path and where after finish grade school it's a Ruff life so I worked at a place that was kind of amazing which I'll tell you a bit about in this time ring on open source robotics and trying to make robots more usable by normal people not just about whispers add this song industry and academia to industry where we see all the same research questions coming up and the nice thing about being able to walk the Lions as that you can be grounded in real-world problems while also drawing up on all the theory that we've got in human-computer interaction and human-robot interaction play Jesus the ology anthropology what do we do about people that we can apply to the design of technology right to make it better for us to work for us Yvette Caruso I'm actually from not that far away who's a little bit like a wave in little colder no worries intercruises we are where the red star is right now and it's not that far away I would encourage you to consider coming to visit and because it's other places that do fun robotics work to on the farm we have in our dear who getting the way is it going to the parking lot and they working for my office all the time that 30 is also and they will buy your tyres if they see you in the car walkway is looking on at Oban Stanford is a beautiful place and that is a beautiful place 2 it's about 40 minutes drive from play offices so applications for study human right in Irish this very moment that happened just up the hill from here we went from this people that computers with his big Monsters machines in rooms where you had to be a person with the job of the new computer in order to make use of that technology right and you know places like SRA and 80s park and then an apple the point where computers became personal and usable by end-users people for not necessarily trains right so it took this amazing technology Spotify calculator put them in the hands of normal people never get to see what they did with that and it's been pretty amazing that you have supercomputers in your pocket for granted next space to where you probably want to have a PhD in computer science or about if you're going to do anything you so with these things and but I think I'm more exciting future would be one where we can put these tools in the hands of other people who are not necessarily true set a timer on that actually this was invented here at the resort about 1 made of one even the girls and it was an awesome product the team here was prototyping different kinds of tasks of these robots with your other home and this kind of reminds me of a reason why in the home in dishwasher it will a grand trip this idea from PR1 stole the couple of their PhD students and appear to Adam that has become a research platform that you probably seen in a bunch of places that have YouTube videos right from robotics research labs set another people tender point to when they talk about we'll garage by Roger Miller Park natural far away I think what when does the things that we've learnt from building that thing first of all people don't want Â£500 manipulation robots in their home weather for yes working on the thing is I think things are going to share with you today so yes there were some big Real Robots 32 degree of freedom of manipulation platforms does it mean it out into the world is products I think also teaches a bit of a lesson about you know how should we take bits of robotics a bit of a tummy the products and services that can help people for those to do with you no remote collaboration and this is my coworker voice in a box on a table as far as I was concerned tell us would be the thing talking in the middle of the desk and we'll be having this questions about how to make decisions about you know which kind of board should be using for the motor controller figure 2 roulette engineering team made decisions that time the table in Scream at each other for hours until somebody one and Dallas was screaming as a Voice In A Box in the table he was saying they wouldn't hang up on happened when we lost the connection my bad by the way this is a decision we came up with an like you're going to have to help with employment redalice was not awesome turn friends on the company hoover to the Flooring with the card with them inside they help them out of it define will give you a laptop we will see your face maybe there will be harder for people to hang up Skype on a laptop on a card which was the system a little better it is a little harder to hang up on someone when they can see you reach for the power cable sometimes we would for you meaning have a conversation in the kitchen can we actually do like the real discussion in the meeting we pretend like we're having a discussion again to make a decision but actually everything have what does orphan how work really gets done no he was still kind of missing the real decision-making because I asked you just like some guy who was annoying and had to be added to meaning living in town when we can just before the big battlebots competition because he was about about competitor table status of the Good Shepherd Collier Row your shopping list things out peterside there's still somebody play Monday this is Dallas actually coming into work looking like that with the big lad acid battery the Beast a very expensive castor in the back and here he can now pass on us to ask questions that he already has an email but this time you actually the answer because if you don't he's not going to get out the door when we belong tell your mobile robot in a space with the face actually you're really close friend and that's called a day Dallas King this robot let me talk to you and hangout with everyday speak to be truly honest I thought it was stupid the first time that I saw it is like that but that's so give me the right and like that we like it because you like robots analyse person what we wearing was that his like we got to meet his kids because our time zone difference is Kingswood drive around in the office about 16 when we play pool he will come and hang out with us you would sometimes go in like I attract cancer much just a screw with a human friend and a colleague and Southern when we had big discussions are we going at each other at the room films like the 34 anything really effective because he had no presents because it was really hard Western Norman turn off I'm ok how long is big robots that are really fancy and do everything there is the robot dead what's the value in doing this too so this became a little skunk or Cyprus the team to send a build a few more skins is there something you know it's just Skype on a stick on Wheels writing so I know they're about to say that's not a robot fine whatever you can advise her to it we did have hope yours down here so you could do you know some of school boys the real question was play music is it going to be valuable enough to be worth putting up with the hassle that's what they trying to me and I like Lola you do with humans you will figure this out volume dealt with humans he came to filbeys in the world I will say just you know because it is an agora classroom we're not in Memphis what's the biggest in for decades before we ever did that will be grand so I think the earliest one was from the personal rolling presents or the proper system they are colours UC Berkeley remember when we first started talking about this work at araki like thank you for finally doing the usual size that might by your side should I done but I didn't cos it was too much Ashley back in the 90s if you tried to do video conferencing in oh streaming video and audio up and down constantly in a building you would bring down the network the building within about I think just that time the wireless network smart prepare we are doing it was kind of sort of another really funny one that I like is here this is HP Labs say they actually had a 360-degree view of the person so you could identify them home for the back of their heads are walking on the hallway the thing was so wild that barely fit through doors I didn't really fit through doorways so what kind of feels fine I had a much larger and ghost of course because that's stop here to think about right when you're building was systems Now more products on the market with these things are really being built right in so because of wireless networks are ready because you actually need to have it on about anime to make this work at April using them for a doctor's to do rounds rights of a specialist who the patient is the sea for your particular clinic doesn't have that kind of specialist around they can use one of these systems what does doctors coming to check you out with the help of the nurses and other staff network systems early other types of systems that have since been also nowhere have someone talking to your chest does the science of sort of you know disappeared now but we're learning everytime you know what is a socially appropriate way of talking to someone be over about Marseilles rebel play present so you know if your easy girls and say you can make an Android that looks just like yourself turn off the music now you're in Grand in the scope of material to say whatever they want you to say is there a challenge with this rate is turn the Android for every person can you get a look like yourself which is pretty learning about is that you age but your robot doesn't doesn't turn lights on and people cancel compario so there's challenges here this you go about this you're about to creepy can I tell him no so one of the challenges that we pose was ok now got a building for everything a person cancel that was when he doesn't like a baby because baby is anonymous people they could turn into anybody sorted like a tomo go to you so you know you can talk to your grandma on the robot that looks like that what are the problem I don't understand but I think you know there are different cultural backgrounds that we are coming from that make things more less socially acceptable so I think I'll just don't get the wall design Direction and isn't working on some really cool robots that look like humans in the ocean and you know there are places where maybe you do want to talk like a person because then you can tell you operated more effectively so if I can't scuba dive we need the veil discovered I have to get the symbols on the ocean that we want so maybe it doesn't make sense move like we do so that I have a more natural understanding of how to control that thing right that maybe one argument for going in this Direction so nothing bad I just think One Direction it might be wrong turns on what you're trying to achieve for that and use it what is it gold of the task is that I'm made up some vocabulary if you catch me some local I mean the person who is proximate to the system so the same physical space I'm talking about the person like Dallas in Indiana becoming here in California via robot what is music to like robots and that's how are using listening or is there something able that other people catching make you so we already have video conferencing and works pretty well is this going to be any better and so use overtime in for much longer than this by the end of the study but at the beginning of the study we want to publish something that were going out with you here today so different companies in our own Indian place in the letter Shadows play music I don't use it in the product owner that wasn't like this thing and see if you want it as they all these sites they had those big videoconferencing systems up in the walls for public spaces are all shut off so I do think there are some limitations of current video conferencing that don't make persistent presence physical robot body is relocated during the same Cisco barrier because he's a prototype something break all the name time thermal Palace were actually removed my favourite remote pilot was actually here who was everybody's favourite seven would fix things at 2 a.m. because 2 a.m. for him am for us friends sending emails and they wanted and they come into work in the morning wait for the team and when he visited in person he says they got like hands and hi-fi from everybody because he was everybody's favourite to set everybody series Hammond for the cleaning staff who we forgot to breathe when was you can imagine like you used to Dunelm brown Bag talk where we go people who heads up like a little me the singer when your space it's not it doesn't have don't worry about it you didn't win the folks who were going to be there in the moment because we didn't know that there is terrifying I'm doing Billingham network we normally was quite in the status of Emma's super upset everyone everyone I just leave her going to be interacting with during the day do with the assistance right the first thing is in order can do what they do when they're done the office in person but this is not really that different from the chat they normally happens in offices what's more interesting doing is where they were doing it and so if you look at the physical location is in the office with her talking right usually we use fancy videoconferencing systems like this one like a lecture Hall meeting room with like a fancy table using informal communication kitchenette with a real conversation happens before the meeting where everyone actually make at the this people inside the best bass actually to talk with folks tends to be to make the coffee stripping in so you can chat with them and it became a roof in the walk away I'm busy I'm waiting for my coffee instead maybe give you text freezing with systems is work that is like the video conferencing written by an artist and a lot of work in the cscw space and computer supported co-operative work in that teleconferencing systems basically support three things is an intern and Rob education is kind of similar so the first thing that we see is bothered to show but in that chair in our present and taking notes and participate 18 that you care about your project you care about your shadow types of collaboration director for Firefly he live in Tirana well he would do is long and that video camera in the back of the room so I can't like these cameras that is a nice gift to see you the audience Susan that camera but if you show up and robot which is actually but to do your teammates then feel like you care come and chat with you afterwards rain turns out that he was actually blocking the view of the women solution for overall right there so better about him being there director because they could just chat with him he was more just like a person who is present and you cared play that I briefly touch on earlier right as you can get people's attention when you send an email that just some text on the screen that something in your when you run a someone's office in Blackbird or wait until you didn't answer the question until you feel like it was Careless someone does barging into your office are counting on you will always same thing that they can keep your touch on longer than they could the other media turn over time had to hear that Robot coming because there is a cycle really high pitch sound at the motor controllers turn on the bedroom light to Dallas ring you can put the building because he can't open doors does my work around that problem you can sometimes tell with the person is coming in your office inside if you want to pretend like you there or not something later on we used to have Motors are silent play me whenever they really want that was a little sterling certainly doing a little bit annoyed because people appear behind someone next super important is this hanging out and building real Social connections getting there because it's people stop Manchester person who sit with timetable from at 5 or something on Friday start playing pool Just Cause it was a thing to do this is a super work table that was not that great quite frankly the robots will kick her but playing this because you're easy for robots and hard for people nobody was very good at it and if you are there via robot you don't get to play pool because you don't have call the people playing play something the characters do it how you build rapport how you build a relationship kind of relationship is what makes it possible to have difficult conversations later on when you into without feeling like a really being friends you'll understand that everyone's on the same side when you hang out together can get through the hardest if you can work through the hard stuff better and more effectively once you've not in person Hangouts so give us some evidence that maybe there's something there and so is that a company called suitable technologies that was a lot I just got purchased this is the interface came out during that time it was a lot worse before I promise and see you drag your body around the other graphical user interface when will the web browser-based interface and then we decide you need 1 people tend to forget what they look like when they're robot and remind them by putting mirrors around this place looking really important because you are not going to present themselves so that was what came out of that work why there is enough confidence to sell it maybe there's something steam shower mat that was I Robot I always get this question so the photo do the Big Bang Theory show really really do their homework like they're they're real name play YouTube video of the first prototypes when like nobody cared I was looking at it and then it called the party man is everyone I use a robot for whatever episodes is that call our team was so giddy with excitement that we drop everything that we're doing to help them do this play kirkmyres who's on this team the core team that developed that's using the battle box when was The Big Bang Theory so much that he had there theme song as his wedding march down the aisle bears called it was freaking awesome everything to do this show was not perfect the screen wasn't really that bright right if you've seen in all displays like that and so they had to shoot the interior of a sudden was in the dark fly to everybody else's faces but I can't bosniak was the guest actor on this particular episode 3 sign the back of its head everything's crazy things they never would have expected with this regards you know who Yahoo want to be the United States physically because did you want to build a tax rates at their messages heard and so turns out you can you tell us about that because I can't hear the rest of robot fine whatever I'm stuck music to give a TED talk not use the word anticipated I do exploratory field that is because for me that's the best inspiration for finding light what are the important based on those questions this is about what if we designed it this way but if we designed that way right how might we make it better testify by The Scissor uncontrolled experiment so they look like experiments acceptance I'm only having people use her other to also happens behavioural what date is your figure out how those design changes actually affect user experience and use of the system prototype for integrating those lessons and then rinse and repeat those were times tomorrow from them so just a couple of examples of these to have a flavour but that looks like a human reminder create a call to work out with designers and other folks to know how to study humans as well as your body says to know what's possible to build what is really doable are there any questions what does angle on the system is to make people feel like the remote co-workers are actually part of the Psychology with behaviour big game right hand side the red shirts are in group on the Boucher to the outgroup actually Mark with you powerful visual cue to tell you who's on your son who's not who is Tuesday for the football team in Houston natural the football team computers things accenting the humans does when you choose two people so if I give you you're on the Bluetooth like you just are you a little blue border and I tell you put that around the frame of your computer screen just some desktop to that computer you will spend more time with it and you think it's more competent redwater it's a rational we know that thing is not human it's not really teammate that's not even really my team because you just told me what team Amazon with pretty much on you in the know who is professor who is one of us and who is not and we tender extended to other things besides just the myvod interior glycerin s and wondering the conversation like this because you know computers great writing about the blue person about the robot everything's going to be good won't be friends probably wrong play this study with Irene Ray were University of wisconsin-madison at the time ruin the robot they disagree and see if they can come tomorrow agreement at the end will do a questionnaire so this is what that said he look like we randomly assigned them so the condition where they personalise a system like me giving the stuff to personalise it with or not do a task occasionally answers so we use the desert survival task which is a lot of fun was getting answer wrong with a super confident in there turn on this cover story of a game but say that you're in the desert you are a bus tours and your bus crashes 10 items to survive your job is to write them in order of importance for survival I think that we know what items are important for survival most people really don't but they do feel very strongly about being so individual calendar actually I can't edit an outfit turn them to see if their new answers online more with their partners or they just stick to the guns right side of the radio disclosure interview at the end and chat with them about what their experiences like so what happened we did a between Buddhism and study meaning call me cells was only in a one condition of the study right they didn't do all of them could not decorate the robot where people who did that spell trade a framing that we know what is Utah study working in Great Yarmouth just your answer on your right you get a point both of your team your interdependently scored because we know this can work and I want to see how it compares with decorator vs not talking over the score both of you together interdependent scoring that you would be more involved with your partner then if you're independently score the evidence of so people will disclose more information about themselves if they told that their final performance further into depend call sound as humans feel like someone is an output member we tend to meet my animal like emotions to them animal like the things that are basic right so anger for your happiness emotions are more things like what is the people to be more animal like emotions to a team that you don't really care about turn the key pezenas remember play they like the poem or return to the planet look I never know that so the manipulation manipulation word do I care about right was if we do the boot in renting thing and let people decorated to look like themselves when they're going to be nicer to that person and treat them well I can't remember ignore with statistical significance no happening in Our Data was that if you decorated the robot you did not co-operate as much with your partner turn on the switch experimental is you need to be open to all the possibilities out there what are the competing hypotheses in the predicted this results when we do the debriefing with these participants but they told us pretty consistently was list turn the decorating condition building relationships with the machine with the proxy but now with the percent on the other side play we think yes computers are social actors are about social actors but in the telepresence situation when the actor is actually a person inside of a machine play The Orient in white or the Machine one way we think that we might be able to fix this rate is instead of having the local person just decorating machine and have some random person log into it turn volume Two and a chat and together they decorate the machine right so tomorrow like an activity that's done together as opposed to one the sun independently and that's actually some follow-up work that we've been doing with that UFC let you know this decorating thing it just keeps happening when people get robots that one and put stuff on it to customise it for themselves and so what are the psychological effects don't let people decorate the room before the telepresence login person that came up on driving robot especially robots I have weird configurations like Irish wear a dress like a fork good forklift drivers are really hard to find telepresence robot drivers are too it is hard to walk and Talk supposed to do with this thing you would happen if people driving around cannot like Bumble in the place and they get 2 mg and they just sit there play some the screen the whole point of having presents his physical presence here that you don't have to do that you could move around if you wanted to you can be more online and her presents so what if we added autonomous assistance right it's always a little bit of a obstacle will it not make Mr spell relying on the base and you know it's just doing a little sweet but this level and so you could probably avoid things like table legs for chairs are trash against walls and doors fly are we created it cost me up around the space of the robot and the pilot tried to drive into this desk it wouldn't let me it would actually like replaying my path around there so so get to where I'm trying to go but it would make me not make mistakes and hit stuff is it going to work and is it going to work on humans have it in their hands that was the place they were looking what's the things in that way like chairs and trash cans in Bourne people you know go ahead and practice as much as you want and to feel comfortable with let us know when you're ready go we measure how fast I can do the also course and how many things they hit so time on Task and Airwaves for the standard performance match where we did the controlled experiment with animals and people don't want to conditions where they have no one's home assistants we just turn the light off you have a time assistance where we don't let them run into things one other thing because we were that it was going to matter personality dimension and personality psychology from the 70s that control here this this is all about can you feel like you shouldn't be in in the world so if you have a very strong control you probably believe things I can all stuff just happens in all things things goes ago and you know I'm not really the one who's going to be controlling that really I roll with the punches strong internal locus of control you are the master of your own because you're amazing if you failed because you're terrible right you believe that you're in control of what happens now or somewhere along this Continuum so we measure this is a personality dimension and then we put people into buckets depending on the median split what are the expected this was that if you have on swings you'll hit your things we hope that you can drive fast around so you should be able to do the task better if you got a sister yeah if you have absolutely no hope your things one thing it was below the level of the light oh that's a big difference that's a big effect size praising one little for us so if you have a Thomas assistant so you won't hit them open YouTube switch expect little deeper that other variable so long as a control destiny find out in control control4 could you give me a time assistance basically one that stands out different than the other where's the closest thing in Blow how will be the person who really loves driving a stick shift car I'm going to hit the tracking watch my head and there is showing you that they're frustrated by performing worse right there like I want to cut that time play we're actually singer performance and decrement which is important to think about designing timer systems more assistance that they were intended to help their intended to make us do better to drive better to fly planes better if you've got the wrong personality type match with that I'm as assistants you can get in trouble by the way we have this extra economist thing that's going to be course cracking and see what happens someone that can be caused at whatever you give them any override right cos that's currently that often a design decision and depending when you billions about is the right thing to do if you could answer that is a bunch of different variations that we couldn't have it should do I'm sorry it's like these to figure out really you know how is it that the human dimensions are going to be interacting with these autonomous what time you can be amazing you maybe don't want to tell them by the way they take control away from you it's just helping you out you won't have to listen to it we don't want to yeah sky's didn't get assistance assistance vs someone is narcissistic change the precision of like the you know what are the consequences of hitting a trash can consequences even more than that so I didn't can't people are more careful in different situations opinion will say one weird thing that I keep staying with this telepresence robots is there a remote location your physical body is sometimes I don't take it so seriously so we've had people log into these robot chase down our coworkers because I think it's fun play some little big game live turn the sound like restaurant over that person like that's not nice person they will actually blade in it will actually hurt there is some we need to explore there around responsibility and like really understanding the consequences of her actions other remote number for EE call Aidan I do the stuff on my own with an amazing SoundCloud breakers on this project these are just a few of them and they come from also I'm using closest right and so like one person doesn't do it especially field studies people to get that stuff done right like spreading out across and companies to shadow people is there doing at work talking with them but difficult things going on of course we never do this stuff on her own
